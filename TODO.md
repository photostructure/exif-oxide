## üîÑ CURRENT PHASE

### Phase 1: Multi-Format Read Support Preparation
**Status**: Ready to begin
**Previous Phase**: Spike 6 completed with all critical tasks finished

## ‚è≥ PLANNED PHASES

### Phase 1: Multi-Format Read Support 
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks  
**Goal**: Support reading from all 43 currently-detected file formats  
**Details**: ‚Üí [`doc/TODO-PHASE1-MULTIFORMAT.md`](doc/TODO-PHASE1-MULTIFORMAT.md)

**Key Tasks**:
- Extend core parsers beyond JPEG (TIFF, HEIF, PNG, WebP)
- Container format parsers (RIFF, QuickTime, MP4)  
- Integration & format dispatch in main.rs

**Parallelization**: Core parser extension and container parsers can be developed in parallel

### Phase 2: Maker Note Parser Expansion
**Duration**: 3-4 weeks
**Goal**: Port all major manufacturer maker note parsers from ExifTool
**Details**: ‚Üí [`doc/TODO-PHASE2-MAKERNOTES.md`](doc/TODO-PHASE2-MAKERNOTES.md)

**Key Tasks**:
- Nikon, Sony maker notes (high complexity, 1 week each)
- Olympus, Pentax, Fujifilm, Panasonic (standard complexity)
- ProcessBinaryData framework implementation

**Parallelization**: Manufacturer implementations are completely independent - excellent for parallel development

### Phase 3: Write Support Framework  
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks
**Goal**: Add safe metadata writing capabilities
**Details**: ‚Üí [`doc/TODO-PHASE3-WRITE.md`](doc/TODO-PHASE3-WRITE.md)

**Key Tasks**:
- Safe write architecture (backup/rollback)
- JPEG and TIFF write support
- Maker note preservation during writes

**Parallelization**: JPEG and TIFF writers can be developed in parallel

### Phase 4: Advanced Features & Production Readiness
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks  
**Goal**: Performance optimization and production features
**Details**: ‚Üí [`doc/TODO-PHASE4-ADVANCED.md`](doc/TODO-PHASE4-ADVANCED.md)

**Key Tasks**:
- Memory mapping, SIMD optimization, parallel processing
- Remaining video/professional formats  
- Async API, WASM support, plugin system

**Parallelization**: Performance optimizations, format support, and advanced features are independent

## Critical Path Dependencies

1. **‚úÖ Spike 6 completion** ‚Üí Phase 1 can begin
2. **Core parser extension** (Phase 1) ‚Üí Maker note work can parallelize  
3. **ProcessBinaryData framework** ‚Üí Complex maker notes (Sony, Nikon)
4. **Multi-format read** (Phase 1) ‚Üí Write support (Phase 3)

## Development Timeline Estimates

### With 1 Developer (Sequential)
- **Total**: 9-11 weeks *(revised down from 12-14)*
- ~~Spike 6: 2-3 days~~ **‚úÖ COMPLETE**
- Phase 1: 2-3 weeks
- Phase 2: 3-4 weeks  
- Phase 3: 2-3 weeks
- Phase 4: 2-3 weeks

### With 2 Developers (Smart Parallelization)
- **Total**: 6-8 weeks *(revised down from 8-10)*
- ~~Spike 6: 2-3 days~~ **‚úÖ COMPLETE**
- Phase 1: 2 weeks (split core + containers)
- Phase 2: 2 weeks (split manufacturers)
- Phase 3: 2 weeks (split JPEG + TIFF)
- Phase 4: 2 weeks (split optimizations)

### With 4+ Developers (Maximum Parallelization)
- **Total**: 4-6 weeks *(revised down from 6-8)*
- ~~Spike 6: 2-3 days~~ **‚úÖ COMPLETE**
- Phase 1: 1 week (4 parallel tracks)
- Phase 2: 1.5 weeks (each developer takes 1-2 manufacturers)
- Phase 3: 1 week (parallel write implementations)
- Phase 4: 1.5 weeks (parallel advanced features)

## Current Project Status

### Format Coverage
- **Detection**: 43/52+ formats (83%)
- **Parsing**: JPEG only (needs Phase 1)
- **Write Support**: None (needs Phase 3)

### Manufacturer Support  
- **Canon**: Complete (maker notes, binary extraction)
- **Others**: Detection only (needs Phase 2)

### Performance Metrics
- **JPEG parsing**: <10ms for typical files
- **Memory usage**: <5MB for typical operations
- **ExifTool compatibility**: 100% for supported features

## Success Criteria

### Phase Completion Requirements
- [ ] All planned formats can be read (Phase 1)
- [ ] All major manufacturers supported (Phase 2)  
- [ ] Safe write operations implemented (Phase 3)
- [ ] Production-ready performance & features (Phase 4)

### Quality Metrics
- **Compatibility**: 95%+ tag extraction match with ExifTool
- **Performance**: 10-20x faster than ExifTool maintained
- **Safety**: No panics on malformed input
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite with real-world files

## Next Actions

1. ~~**Complete Spike 6**: Fix remaining datetime intelligence integration~~ **‚úÖ COMPLETE**
2. **Begin Phase 1**: Choose approach for multi-format read support
3. **Choose Phase 1 strategy**: Core parser extension vs container parsing first
4. **Assign developer priorities**: Based on expertise and available resources
5. **Set up parallel branches**: For independent development tracks

This structured approach leverages the excellent foundation already built while maximizing development velocity through strategic parallelization.
