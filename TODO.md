## 🔄 CURRENT PHASE

**Status**: Moving to Phase 2 - Maker Note Parser Expansion

## ⏳ PLANNED PHASES

### Phase 2: Maker Note Parser Expansion

**Duration**: 3-4 weeks
**Goal**: Port all major manufacturer maker note parsers from ExifTool
**Details**: → [`doc/TODO-PHASE2-MAKERNOTES.md`](doc/TODO-PHASE2-MAKERNOTES.md)

**Key Tasks**:

- Nikon, Sony maker notes (high complexity, 1 week each)
- Olympus, Pentax, Fujifilm, Panasonic (standard complexity)
- ProcessBinaryData framework implementation

**Parallelization**: Manufacturer implementations are completely independent - excellent for parallel development

### Phase 3: Write Support Framework

**Duration**: 2-3 weeks
**Goal**: Add safe metadata writing capabilities
**Details**: → [`doc/TODO-PHASE3-WRITE.md`](doc/TODO-PHASE3-WRITE.md)

**Key Tasks**:

- Safe write architecture (backup/rollback)
- JPEG and TIFF write support
- Maker note preservation during writes

**Parallelization**: JPEG and TIFF writers can be developed in parallel

### Phase 4: Advanced Features & Production Readiness

**Duration**: 2-3 weeks  
**Goal**: Performance optimization and production features
**Details**: → [`doc/TODO-PHASE4-ADVANCED.md`](doc/TODO-PHASE4-ADVANCED.md)

**Key Tasks**:

- Memory mapping, SIMD optimization, parallel processing
- Remaining video/professional formats
- Async API, WASM support, plugin system

**Parallelization**: Performance optimizations, format support, and advanced features are independent

## Critical Path Dependencies

1. **✅ Spike 6 completion** → Phase 1 can begin
2. **Core parser extension** (Phase 1) → Maker note work can parallelize
3. **ProcessBinaryData framework** → Complex maker notes (Sony, Nikon)
4. **Multi-format read** (Phase 1) → Write support (Phase 3)

## Development Timeline Estimates

### With 1 Developer (Sequential)

- **Total**: 9-11 weeks _(revised down from 12-14)_
- ~~Spike 6: 2-3 days~~ **✅ COMPLETE**
- Phase 1: 2-3 weeks
- Phase 2: 3-4 weeks
- Phase 3: 2-3 weeks
- Phase 4: 2-3 weeks

### With 2 Developers (Smart Parallelization)

- **Total**: 6-8 weeks _(revised down from 8-10)_
- ~~Spike 6: 2-3 days~~ **✅ COMPLETE**
- Phase 1: 2 weeks (split core + containers)
- Phase 2: 2 weeks (split manufacturers)
- Phase 3: 2 weeks (split JPEG + TIFF)
- Phase 4: 2 weeks (split optimizations)

### With 4+ Developers (Maximum Parallelization)

- **Total**: 4-6 weeks _(revised down from 6-8)_
- ~~Spike 6: 2-3 days~~ **✅ COMPLETE**
- Phase 1: 1 week (4 parallel tracks)
- Phase 2: 1.5 weeks (each developer takes 1-2 manufacturers)
- Phase 3: 1 week (parallel write implementations)
- Phase 4: 1.5 weeks (parallel advanced features)

## Current Project Status

## Next Actions

1. ~~**Complete Spike 6**: Fix remaining datetime intelligence integration~~ **✅ COMPLETE**
2. ~~**Complete Phase 1**: Multi-format read support implementation~~ **✅ COMPLETE**
3. **Begin Phase 2**: Maker Note Parser Expansion
4. **Priority manufacturer implementations**: Nikon, Sony, Olympus (highest impact)
5. **Implement ProcessBinaryData framework**: Foundation for complex maker notes
6. **Set up parallel manufacturer development**: Independent tracks for each brand

This structured approach leverages the excellent foundation already built while maximizing development velocity through strategic parallelization.
