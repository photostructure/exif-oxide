**# How to Write Good Documentation**

## Core Principles

**Start with Purpose**

- Write a 1-2 sentence summary explaining what the document covers and who should read it
- Use descriptive, concise titles (e.g., "API Authentication Guide" not "auth_stuff_v2")
- State prerequisites upfront

**Respect Reader Time**

- Keep documents under 300-500 lines; split longer content into focused sub-documents
- Use clear, precise language. Avoid unnecessary prose.
- Define jargon when necessary
- Front-load critical information

## Writing Effectively

**Capture Tribal Knowledge**

- Document "everyone knows" assumptions that aren't written anywhere
- Include common pitfalls and their solutions
- Explain _why_, not just _how_
- Record edge cases and workarounds

## Make It Useful

**Actionable Content**

- If relevant, provide working, copy-pasteable examples
- Include expected outputs
- Add troubleshooting sections
- Specify version numbers

**Enable Discovery**

- Link to source code, APIs, and related docs
- Use searchable keywords and descriptive link text
- Date your documentation and mark deprecated sections
- Include contact info for subject matter experts

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] A newcomer could follow without help
- [ ] All links work
- [ ] Code examples are tested
- [ ] Answers what, why, when, and how

Remember: Good documentation is a living artifact. Plan for updates from the start.
