# Make a new TPP

We need to stop now and hand that work off to another engineer. Please output a technical project plan, using our style guide, @docs/TPP.md, to ensure the next engineer succeeds at completing your incomplete tasks. As the style guide states, include a description of the issue being addressed, code and docs they should study, issues you've already addressed, success criteria, and any other tribal knowledge that you can pass down to help them to help them succeed. Ultrathink.

# Low context

We're going to have to stop now. Please update your technical project plan (TPP) using our style guide, @docs/TPP.md. Your goal is to ensure the next engineer succeeds in picking up where you just left off. Include a description of the issues being addressed, code and docs they should study, issues and tasks you've already addressed, success criteria, and any other context or tribal knowledge that you can pass down to help them to complete your tasks. Please correct any glaring inaccuracies that you find in the TPP. Include any refactorings you considered to improve the code you visited as possible future work to consider. If you don't remember what TPP you're working off of, **please ask**.

# When the initial plan is hand-wavy

That's really great analysis! As this touches pivotal architectural underpinnings for this project, it warrants in-depth research and study. For anything "hand-wavy" or uncertain, check source, check docs, check generated code, and, most importantly, check ExifTool source. Ultrathink and re-analyze. Consider alternative approaches, weigh their pros and cons, and hybridize our current plan with those improvements. Take care not to expand scope without asking if it is still relevant to the tasks at hand. Also, make sure you've reviewed relevant planned and "completed" TPPs in docs/todo and docs/done for additional historical or future planning context (there may be opportunities to clarify or coordinate effort in pending TPPs).

# Refining an existing TPP

Let's do more due diligence research, analysis, and planning for the work described in ⭐ . Re-analyze and re-plan the TPP using the @docs/TPP.md style guide. Ultrathink and study all related documentation and source code before making any changes. This is critical infrastructure for this project, so we have a large time budget for research, planning, analysis, and validation for this work. As @CLAUDE.md states, ask clarifying questions for anything odd, confusing, nebulous, or to help decide between alternative strategies.

# Starting work on a TPP

Let's work through the tasks listed in ⭐ -- note that this work requires a TON of pre-study to get this addressed, so you're going to ultrathink and deep-dive into every single referenced source and doc, carefully validate and re-analyze the current situation, problem, and solution before starting. In this initial planning phase, please run relevant tooling and tests to validate the current state of the code. @CLAUDE.md and @docs/TRUST-EXIFTOOL.md provide invaluable project context and guidelines.

# Continuing work on a TPP

Let's continue work through the tasks listed in ⭐ -- note that this work requires a TON of pre-study to get this addressed, so you're going to have to ready into every single referenced source and doc, carefully validate and re-analyze the current situation, problem, and solution before starting. Any marked progress in the TPP should be considered circumspect: prior engineers may have recorded their progress a bit... ehm, "optimistically," so we need to validate the state of the world before continuing by studying code and running relevant tooling and tests. @CLAUDE.md and @docs/TRUST-EXIFTOOL.md provide invaluable project context and guidelines.

# Validating and continuing work on a (probably complete) TPP

Carefully review and validate the tasks listed in ⭐ -- this is critical infrastructure for this project, so we have a large time budget for research, planning, analysis, and validation for this work. Take it step by step and show your work. At the end of your planning, we want to update the TPP using this style guide: @docs/TPP.md . Prior engineers may have recorded progress a bit "optimistically" or flat-out lied, so everything should be circumspect. Correct any inaccuracies that you find. Any additional helpful context that you can add to the TPP that may assist the next engineer complete this work successfully will be invaluable (as the TPP style guide suggests). We want to complete the work in this TPP, so if, after your planning and research phase, there are incomplete tasks found, we want you to work on them. If all the tasks are complete, please update the TPP to reflect this, and move the document into `docs/done/$YYYYMMDD-${tpp_basename}` (check the current date with `date` -- we're in TZ `America/Los_Angeles`)
