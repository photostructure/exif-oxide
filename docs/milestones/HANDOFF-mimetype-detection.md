● The failing tests show these mismatches:

  1. CR3 files (Canon): ExifTool='image/x-canon-cr3', Ours='image/tiff'
  2. ASF.wmv: ExifTool='video/x-ms-wmv', Ours='image/jpeg'

     ☐ Fix the MIME type detection issues
     ☐ Run tests to verify fixes

● Now I understand the issues. Let me analyze each failure:

  1. CR3 files - Detected as TIFF instead of CR3. The issue is that CR3 is MOV-based but our code is checking for TIFF magic first.
  2. ASF.wmv - Detected as JPEG instead of ASF. This suggests the ASF magic pattern isn't matching.
  3. JXL2.jxl - Failed to detect. Need to check if JXL pattern is working.
  4. jump.mp4 - Failed to detect. MP4 detection issue.
  5. Jpeg2000.j2c - Failed to detect. J2C pattern issue.
  6. nikon_z8_73.NEF - Detected as NEF but ExifTool reports NRW. This suggests file extension or content mismatch.

  Let me check if these files have magic patterns defined:

  ⎿  Found 8 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Now let me check what's going wrong. Let's look at how our file detection processes these specific cases:

● Read(src/bin/debug_patterns.rs)
  ⎿  Read 40 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me understand the specific issue better by examining a test case:

     ☐ Fix the MIME type detection issues

● Let me write a test program to diagnose the issues:

● Write(src/bin/diagnose_mime_failures.rs)
  ⎿  Wrote 111 lines to src/bin/diagnose_mime_failures.rs         
     use exif_oxide::file_detection::FileTypeDetector;

● Now let me run the diagnostic program:

● Bash(cargo run --bin diagnose_mime_failures)
  ⎿  Error: Compiling exif-oxide v0.1.0 (/mnt/2tb/home/mrm/src/exif-oxide)

● I need to fix the compilation error in the generated file. The issue is with lifetime constraints:

  ⎿  (No changes)

> that's a generated file (and it was just re-generated). See @docs/design/EXIFTOOL-INTEGRATION.md and reread everything.
  ⎿  Read docs/design/EXIFTOOL-INTEGRATION.md (648 lines)

● I see the issue now. The code was regenerated, and I need to look at the actual problems with our file detection logic rather than trying to modify
  generated files. Let me run the diagnostic tool to understand what's happening:

● Bash(cargo run --bin diagnose_mime_failures 2>/dev/null)
  ⎿  === Testing: test-images/canon/canon_eos_r50v_01.cr3 (expecting CR3) ===                                                                          
       Extension: cr3
       First 32 bytes: [00, 00, 00, 18, 66, 74, 79, 70, 63, 72, 78, 20, 00, 00, 00, 01, 63, 72, 78, 20, 69, 73, 6f, 6d, 00, 00, b4, 78, 6d, 6f, 6f, 76]
     … +39 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Now I can see the issues clearly:

  1. CR3 files - Being detected as TIFF instead of MOV-based CR3 (has 'crx ' ftyp brand)
  2. ASF.wmv - ASF GUID is detected but file is reported as JPEG
  3. JXL2.jxl - JXL signature detected but extension not recognized
  4. jump.mp4 - MP4 with 'avc1' brand but extension not recognized
  5. Jpeg2000.j2c - J2C signature detected but extension not recognized
  6. NEF file - Detected as NEF but ExifTool reports it as NRW

  Let me check how our file detection logic handles these cases:

● Read(src/file_detection.rs)
  ⎿  Read 60 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The issues are clear now:

  1. CR3 - Our code doesn't properly handle the MOV subtype detection for CR3 files with 'crx ' brand
  2. ASF/WMV - The ASF magic pattern isn't being used correctly, causing fallback to JPEG
  3. JXL, MP4, J2C - These extensions aren't resolving in our file type lookup

  Let me check if these file types are in the generated lookup:

● Search(pattern: ""CR3"|"JXL"|"MP4"|"J2C"|"WMV"", path: "src/generated/file_types/file_type_lookup.rs", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 7 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● All the file types are present. The issue must be in our detection logic. Let me trace through what's happening:

● I need to understand exactly how ExifTool handles these file types. Let me check the ExifTool source for how it detects these specific formats:

● Now I need to understand the issues better. Let me create a fix for the file detection issues:

     ☐ Fix the MIME type detection issues
     ☐ Run tests to verify fixes

● Based on my analysis, here are the issues:

  1. CR3 files: Being detected as TIFF because our TIFF pattern matches before MOV detection
  2. ASF.wmv: ASF magic is detected but somehow JPEG is returned
  3. JXL/MP4/J2C: Extensions not being resolved properly
  4. NEF vs NRW: ExifTool may be doing deeper content analysis

  Let me fix the file detection logic:

● Write(src/file_types/mod.rs)

● I see the issues are still there. The main problems are:

  1. CR3 files have MOV signature but are being detected as TIFF
  2. Unknown extensions (JXL, MP4, J2C) are not being found
  3. ASF magic is matching but returning JPEG

  Let me debug this more systematically. First, let me check what's happening with the candidate selection:
