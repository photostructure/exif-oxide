# HANDOFF: Boolean Set Implementation

**Date**: 2025-01-16
**Status**: 90% complete - extraction working, generation partially working

## Issue Being Addressed

Implementing boolean set extraction and code generation for ExifTool's membership testing patterns (e.g., `%weakMagic`, `%isDatChunk`). These are hash tables where keys map to `1` and are used for fast membership testing like `if ($isDatChunk{$chunk})`.

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed
1. **Boolean set extractor** (`codegen/extractors/boolean_set.pl`) - fully working
2. **Configuration files created**:
   - `codegen/config/PNG_pm/boolean_set.json` - PNG chunk type sets
   - `codegen/config/ExifTool_pm/boolean_set.json` - Core ExifTool sets
3. **Extraction working** - All boolean sets are successfully extracted to JSON files
4. **Generator implemented** (`codegen/src/generators/data_sets/boolean.rs`) - ready to use
5. **Main.rs updated** - Now looks for both `simple_table.json` and `boolean_set.json` configs
6. **Lookup tables module updated** - Handles both simple tables and boolean sets

### ⚠️ Partially Working
- ExifTool_pm boolean sets are NOT being generated (they should appear at the end of `src/generated/ExifTool_pm/mod.rs` but currently missing)
- PNG_pm module is not being generated at all (no `src/generated/PNG_pm/` directory)

### 🔍 Root Cause (Suspected)
The extracted boolean set JSON files (14 total) are being found by main.rs, but only some are matching their configs. Need to debug why PNG sets aren't matching.

## Code to Study

### Key Files Modified/Created
1. **`codegen/extractors/boolean_set.pl`** - Perl extractor for boolean sets
2. **`codegen/src/extraction.rs`** - Added `BooleanSet` special extractor type
3. **`codegen/src/generators/lookup_tables/mod.rs`** - Extended to handle boolean sets
4. **`codegen/src/main.rs`** - Lines 219-283, updated to check both config types

### Configuration Files
- `codegen/config/PNG_pm/boolean_set.json` - Defines PNG boolean sets
- `codegen/config/ExifTool_pm/boolean_set.json` - Defines ExifTool core sets

### Generated Files to Check
- `codegen/generated/extract/boolean_set_*.json` - All extracted successfully
- `src/generated/ExifTool_pm/mod.rs` - Should have boolean sets at end (currently missing)

## Technical Details

### Boolean Set Pattern in ExifTool
```perl
# Simple membership test
my %isDatChunk = ( IDAT => 1, JDAT => 1, JDAA => 1 );

# Generated from map
my %createTypes = map { $_ => 1 } qw(XMP ICC MIE VRD DR4 EXIF EXV);

# Usage
if ($isDatChunk{$chunk}) { ... }
```

### Expected Generated Rust Code
```rust
/// PNG chunks containing image data (IDAT, JDAT, JDAA)
pub static PNG_DATA_CHUNKS: LazyLock<HashSet<&'static str>> = LazyLock::new(|| {
    let mut set = HashSet::new();
    set.insert("IDAT");
    set.insert("JDAA");
    set.insert("JDAT");
    set
});

/// Check if a chunk is a data chunk
pub fn is_png_data_chunks(chunk: &str) -> bool {
    PNG_DATA_CHUNKS.contains(chunk)
}
```

## Debugging Steps

1. **Enable debug logging**: The tracing crate is set up. Add debug statements in:
   - `process_config_directory()` to log which configs are found
   - When boolean sets are matched/not matched
   - What's in the `all_extracted_tables` HashMap

2. **Check the 14 extracted tables**: Run with debug logging to see which ones are matched vs. unmatched

3. **Verify PNG_pm processing**: The logs show "Processing module: PNG_pm" but no output - need to debug why

## Success Criteria

1. **PNG_pm module generated** with all 3 boolean sets:
   - `PNG_DATA_CHUNKS` (isDatChunk)
   - `PNG_TEXT_CHUNKS` (isTxtChunk)  
   - `PNG_NO_LEAPFROG_CHUNKS` (noLeapFrog)

2. **ExifTool_pm contains boolean sets** at the end:
   - `WEAK_MAGIC_FILE_TYPES` (weakMagic)
   - `CREATABLE_FILE_TYPES` (createTypes)
   - `PROCESS_DETERMINED_TYPES` (processType)
   - `PC_OPERATING_SYSTEMS` (isPC)

3. **All tests pass** with `make precommit`

## Important Notes

1. **Patching System**: The system patches ExifTool modules to convert `my %hash` to `our %hash`. This works correctly but be aware files get modified during extraction.

2. **File Structure**: Boolean sets use the same extraction pipeline as simple tables but generate HashSet instead of HashMap.

3. **Config Matching**: The issue seems to be in main.rs lines 219-283 where configs are matched. PNG sets might not be finding their config due to module name mismatch.

4. **Testing**: Run `make codegen` from project root to test. Look for warnings about "Could not find config for..."

## Next Steps

1. Add debug logging to understand why only 14 tables are found when there should be more
2. Debug why PNG_pm has no content generated despite having a config
3. Verify the ExifTool_pm boolean sets are actually being added (check if they're just not visible due to truncation)
4. Write integration tests for boolean set usage

## Commands for Testing

```bash
# Full regeneration
make codegen

# Check what was extracted
ls codegen/generated/extract/boolean_set_*.json

# Verify PNG sets were extracted  
cat codegen/generated/extract/boolean_set_isDatChunk.json

# Check if PNG_pm was generated
ls -la src/generated/PNG_pm/

# Look for boolean sets in ExifTool_pm
grep -A20 "Boolean set" src/generated/ExifTool_pm/mod.rs
```

Good luck! The implementation is very close - just needs the final debugging to get all boolean sets generating properly.
