# Precedence Climbing Algorithm for AST Parsing

## Introduction

Precedence climbing is a simple, efficient, and flexible parsing algorithm specifically designed for parsing infix expressions and building Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). The algorithm was invented by Martin Richards for use in the CPL and BCPL compilers and is sometimes called "precedence climbing" because it climbs down the precedence levels during parsing. It is fundamentally the same algorithm as Pratt parsing, with Pratt parsing being a more general formulation.

## Core Concept

The basic goal of the algorithm is to treat an expression as a bunch of nested sub-expressions, where each sub-expression has in common the lowest precedence level of the operators it contains. Unlike traditional recursive descent parsing that requires separate nonterminals for each precedence level, precedence climbing uses a single parameterized function that handles all precedence levels.

## Algorithm Overview

The precedence climbing algorithm works by:

1. **Operator-guided parsing**: The algorithm is operator-guided. Its fundamental step is to consume the next atom and look at the operator following it. If the operator has precedence lower than the lowest acceptable for the current step, the algorithm returns. Otherwise, it calls itself in a loop to handle the sub-expression.

2. **Recursive structure**: The algorithm uses recursive calls to implement the stack rather than needing an explicit stack.

3. **Precedence-based control**: The precedence climbing algorithm always directly consumes the first binary operator, then consumes the next binary operator that is of lower precedence, then the next operator that is of lower precedence than that.

## Pseudocode Structure

The algorithm typically consists of two main functions:

```
parse_expression():
    return parse_expression_1(parse_primary(), 0)

parse_expression_1(left_operand, min_precedence):
    while next_token is binary operator with precedence >= min_precedence:
        operator = consume_operator()
        right_operand = parse_primary()

        while next_token has higher precedence than operator OR
              (next_token is right-associative AND has equal precedence):
            right_operand = parse_expression_1(right_operand, next_precedence)

        left_operand = create_binary_node(operator, left_operand, right_operand)

    return left_operand
```

## Key Advantages

### 1. Simplicity

Precedence climbing is the simplest of all expression parsing algorithms. It requires minimal code and is easy to understand and implement.

### 2. Efficiency

The algorithm is highly efficient, requiring only one function call per precedence level rather than multiple recursive calls through separate nonterminal functions.

### 3. Flexible Precedence Handling

New operators and precedence levels can be added by modifying simple precedence and associativity tables. This makes it ideal for languages where operator precedence isn't hard-coded.

### 4. Clean AST Generation

The algorithm produces very simple parse trees where each operator is represented by a nonterminal node labeled with the operator, with two children representing the operands. This tree is essentially an abstract syntax tree with no redundant information.

## Handling Associativity

The algorithm elegantly handles both left and right associativity:

- **Left associativity**: When it consumes a left-associative operator, the same loop will consume the next operator of equal precedence
- **Right associativity**: Right associativity is implemented by making the recursive call with next_min_prec = prec + 1

## Comparison with Other Methods

### vs. Traditional Recursive Descent

Traditional recursive descent requires:

- Separate nonterminals for each precedence level
- Complex grammar transformations to eliminate left recursion
- Long chains of "useless" nonterminal nodes in parse trees

Precedence climbing eliminates these problems with a single parameterized function.

### vs. Shunting Yard

The shunting yard algorithm keeps operators on a stack until both their operands have been parsed, using two separate stacks for operators and operands. Precedence climbing is simpler and doesn't require explicit stack management.

### vs. Pratt Parsing

Precedence climbing is really a special case of Pratt parsing, with Pratt parsing being a generalization that can handle more complex syntactic constructs. However, for basic infix expressions, they are functionally equivalent.

## Practical Implementation Details

### Primary Expression Parsing

A primary expression is one at the highest precedence level: typically literals, variables, and parenthesized expressions. The algorithm delegates parsing of these to a separate `parse_primary()` function.

### Precedence Tables

The algorithm relies on precedence tables that map operators to their precedence values and associativity rules. This table-driven approach makes the parser highly configurable.

### Error Handling

The algorithm can easily incorporate error handling by checking for invalid operator sequences and reporting meaningful error messages when expressions don't conform to the grammar.

## Applications and Extensions

Precedence climbing is widely used in practice because of its:

- **Modularity**: Easy extension through adding new "parselets" to tables
- **Runtime flexibility**: Can support languages that allow dynamic operator declaration
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead compared to other expression parsing methods

## Conclusion

Precedence climbing ends up being used a lot in practice because it strikes an optimal balance between simplicity, efficiency, and flexibility. It solves the common problems of expression parsing while generating clean ASTs that directly reflect the operator precedence and associativity rules of the language. The algorithm's table-driven nature makes it particularly suitable for modern language implementations where operator precedence may need to be configurable or extensible.

For languages with complex expression grammars involving many precedence levels, precedence climbing offers a much cleaner solution than traditional recursive descent approaches, while being simpler to implement than full parser generators.
