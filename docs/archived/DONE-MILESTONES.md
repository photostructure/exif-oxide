# Completed exif-oxide Implementation Milestones

This document contains the history of completed milestones for exif-oxide development.

---

## ✅ Milestone 0a: Minimal CLI & Registry (COMPLETED)

Created basic CLI with JSON output and registry system for PrintConv/ValueConv runtime lookup. Established integration test framework with graceful fallback to raw values for missing implementations.

---

## ✅ Milestone 0b: Code Generation Pipeline (COMPLETED)

Built Perl extraction script to analyze ExifTool tables and generate Rust code with tag constants and conversion references. Established automatic generation of mainstream tags filtered by usage frequency.

---

## ✅ Milestone 1: File I/O & JPEG Detection (COMPLETED)

Implemented file I/O with magic byte detection for JPEG and TIFF formats. Added complete JPEG segment scanner to locate EXIF data in APP1 segments.

---

## ✅ Milestone 2: Minimal EXIF Parser (COMPLETED)

Built TIFF/EXIF header parser with endianness detection and IFD entry processing. Successfully extracted first real tags (Make, Model, Orientation) from Canon test images.

---

## ✅ ExifTool Compatibility Testing (COMPLETED)

Established systematic compatibility testing against ExifTool reference output with automated JSON comparison. Achieved 53/58 test files passing with proper exclusion system for problematic files.

---

## ✅ Milestone 3: More EXIF Formats (COMPLETED)

Added support for BYTE, SHORT, LONG formats with proper endianness and offset-based value extraction. Implemented PrintConv conversion system with first manual implementations for Orientation, ResolutionUnit, and YCbCrPositioning.

---

## ✅ Milestone 4: First PrintConv - Orientation (COMPLETED)

Implemented complete PrintConv registry system with runtime lookup and graceful fallback. Successfully converted Orientation values to human-readable format ("Rotate 270 CW" instead of "8") with exact ExifTool compatibility.

---

## ✅ Milestone 5: SubDirectory & Stateful Reader (COMPLETED)

Built stateful ExifReader with recursion prevention and comprehensive processor dispatch system. Established infrastructure for nested IFD processing with support for ExifIFD, GPS, InteropIFD, and MakerNotes subdirectories.

---

## ✅ Milestone 6: RATIONAL Format & GPS (COMPLETED)

Implemented RATIONAL/SRATIONAL format support with proper endianness and zero-denominator handling. Successfully extracted GPS coordinates as raw rational arrays with GPS IFD subdirectory processing.

---

## ✅ Milestone 7: More PrintConv Implementations (COMPLETED)

Implemented 5 core PrintConv functions: Flash, ColorSpace, WhiteBalance, MeteringMode, and ExposureProgram with exact ExifTool compatibility. Discovered Flash uses direct hash lookup (not bitmask) and added support for manufacturer-specific edge cases.

---

## ✅ Milestone 8a: Enhanced Code Generation & DRY Cleanup (COMPLETED)

Eliminated manual maintenance of conversion references by auto-generating them from ExifTool tables. Implemented milestone-based configuration system for supported tags with quality control gates.

---

## ✅ Milestone 8c: Group-Prefixed Tag Names (COMPLETED)

Implemented group-prefixed tag names ("EXIF:Make", "GPS:GPSLatitude") to eliminate tag name collisions and match ExifTool's -G mode. Updated all tests and compatibility framework to handle prefixed output.

---

## ✅ Milestone 8d: Basic Composite GPS Tags (COMPLETED)

Built composite tag infrastructure with GPS coordinate conversion from raw rational arrays to decimal degrees. Implemented two-phase processing: extract raw tags, then build composite tags with proper dependency handling.

---

## ✅ Milestone 8e: Fix GPS ValueConv vs Composite Confusion (COMPLETED)

Refactored GPS coordinate conversion from ValueConv to proper Composite tags, establishing clean architectural separation. GPS coordinate tags now return raw rational arrays while Composite tags handle coordinate conversion.

---

## ✅ Milestone 8f: Composite Tag Codegen & Infrastructure (COMPLETED)

Extracted 62 composite tag definitions from ExifTool tables and generated complete infrastructure with dependency resolution. Implemented working ShutterSpeed composite demonstrating the foundation for future composite tag expansion.

---

## ✅ Milestone 9: ProcessBinaryData Introduction (COMPLETED)

Implemented comprehensive ProcessBinaryData framework with Sony MakerNote support and tag collision resolution. Built sophisticated tag source tracking system with precedence rules ensuring main EXIF tags override MakerNote tags with same IDs. Successfully resolved Sony A7C II compatibility issue where Sony MakerNote Orientation tag (0x0112) was overwriting main EXIF Orientation tag. Added Sony signature detection following ExifTool's 7 different detection patterns and enhanced Canon MakerNote processing with proper namespacing.

---

## ✅ Milestone 10: Canon MakerNote Expansion (COMPLETED)

Implemented complete Canon MakerNote support with comprehensive offset fixing and manufacturer-specific processing. Built Canon signature detection system identifying cameras via Make field. Implemented Canon offset scheme detection with model-specific logic for 4/6/16/28 byte variants following ExifTool's exact algorithms. Added Canon TIFF footer validation and offset base adjustment with fallback mechanisms. Created ProcessSerialData infrastructure for Canon AF data with variable-length arrays and dynamic sizing expressions. Successfully implemented Canon CameraSettings (ProcessBinaryData) extracting MacroMode, FocusMode, CanonFlashMode with PrintConv lookup tables. Built Canon AFInfo2 processor extracting NumAFPoints, AFAreaWidths arrays, and AF geometry data. Integrated Canon processor dispatch into main EXIF flow with proper precedence handling. Verified with Canon T3i test image showing correct extraction of 6 CameraSettings tags and 9 AFInfo2 tags with proper offset calculations.

---

## ✅ Milestone 8b: TagEntry API & Basic ValueConv (COMPLETED)

Implemented TagEntry API with separate value/print fields to support ExifTool's -# flag functionality. Built ValueConv registry with rational-to-float conversions for FNumber, ExposureTime, and FocalLength. Fixed CLI argument parsing to handle mixed positional arguments allowing files and -TagName# flags in any order. Updated JSON serialization to correctly switch between value and print representations based on -# flags while preserving ExifTool's type quirks. Ensured composite tags are included in JSON output and added comprehensive unit tests for argument parsing patterns.

---

## ✅ Milestone 11: Conditional Dispatch (COMPLETED)

Implemented comprehensive conditional processor dispatch system for runtime processor selection based on data patterns, camera models, and other conditions. Built complete Condition enum supporting DataPattern, ModelMatch, MakeMatch, CountEquals, CountRange, FormatEquals, and boolean logic (And, Or, Not). Added EvalContext for runtime evaluation with access to binary data, count, format, make, and model. Enhanced ProcessorDispatch with ConditionalProcessor support maintaining backwards compatibility with existing dispatch. Implemented regex caching for performance optimization and graceful error handling for invalid patterns. Created comprehensive examples for Canon model-specific CameraInfo table selection, Nikon data pattern-based LensData version selection, and Sony count-based processor dispatch. Added 9 integration tests covering all conditional scenarios including complex boolean logic and precedence handling. Successfully validated with 51/51 compatibility tests passing and all precommit checks clean.
