# Technical Project Plan: IFD Parsing Completeness and Context Resolution

## Project Overview

- **Goal**: Fix ExifIFD context assignment bug where ColorSpace and other ExifIFD tags get assigned to manufacturer contexts instead of ExifIFD context
- **Problem**: ColorSpace (0xA001) is being assigned group1="Canon" instead of correct group1="ExifIFD", causing ExifIFD validation tests to fail
- **Constraints**: Must preserve existing ExifIFD, GPS IFD, and namespace-aware architecture while fixing context assignment precedence, maintain ExifTool compatibility

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDERS

If you read this document, you **MUST** read and follow [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) as well as [TRUST-EXIFTOOL.md](TRUST-EXIFTOOL.md):

- **Trust ExifTool** (Translate and cite references, but using codegen is preferred)
- **Ask clarifying questions** (Maximize "velocity made good")
- **Assume Concurrent Edits** (STOP if you find a compilation error that isn't related to your work)
- **Don't edit generated code** (read [CODEGEN.md](CODEGEN.md) if you find yourself wanting to edit `src/generated/**.*rs`)
- **Keep documentation current** (so update this TPP with status updates, and any novel context that will be helpful to future engineers that are tasked with completing this TPP. Do not use hyperbolic "DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT"/"GROUNDBREAKING PROGRESS" styled updates -- that causes confusion and partially-completed low-quality work)

**NOTE**: These rules prevent build breaks, data corruption, and wasted effort across the team. 

If you are found violating any topics in these sections, **your work will be immediately halted, reverted, and you will be dismissed from the team.**

Honest. RTFM.

## Context & Foundation

**REQUIRED**: Assume reader is unfamiliar with this domain. Provide comprehensive context.

### System Overview

- **Mature IFD Infrastructure**: Complete ExifIFD (20250706), GPS IFD (20250727), and namespace-aware tag storage architecture supporting context-aware processing with `HashMap<(u16, String), TagValue>` storage
- **Sophisticated Context System**: IFD context tracking with group assignment, recursion prevention, and manufacturer-specific MakerNotes processing across 14+ implementations
- **Subdirectory Processing Pipeline**: Generic subdirectory processing with condition evaluation, binary data extraction, and cross-module table references supporting Canon (51% coverage), Nikon, Sony, and others

### Key Concepts & Domain Knowledge

- **ExifIFD Context Assignment Bug**: ColorSpace (0xA001) and potentially other ExifIFD tags get assigned to manufacturer contexts (e.g., Canon) instead of their correct ExifIFD context
- **Processing Order Issue**: ExifIFD subdirectory processing may happen after or concurrently with manufacturer MakerNotes processing, causing context conflicts
- **Working Infrastructure**: ExifIFD subdirectory (0x8769) correctly maps to "ExifIFD" name, but downstream context assignment has precedence issues
- **Test Failures**: Two ExifIFD validation tests fail due to incorrect group1 assignment

### Surprising Context

**CRITICAL**: Document non-intuitive aspects that aren't obvious from casual code inspection:

- **Infrastructure is Sound**: ExifIFD work (20250706-ExifIFD.md) shows comprehensive context tracking, GPS IFD bug (20250727-P10c) resolved namespace collisions with sophisticated architecture
- **Configuration Status Verified**: DNG_pm, Exif_pm, and JPEG_pm configurations all exist contrary to previous claims - no missing configs
- **Sony TAG_PREFIX Already Working**: Sony tags correctly show as "Sony_0x2000", "Sony_0x9001" etc. - no "Tag_xxxx" issue found
- **Real Issue Identified**: ExifIFD validation tests fail because ColorSpace gets group1="Canon" instead of group1="ExifIFD"
- **Context Assignment Mostly Works**: Most namespace switching works correctly; issue is specific to ExifIFD vs manufacturer context precedence
- **Processing Order Investigation**: ExifIFD subdirectory (tag 0x8769) correctly maps to "ExifIFD" name in process_subdirectory_tag() at src/exif/processors.rs:304-306

### Foundation Documents

- **Completed Architecture**: [20250706-ExifIFD.md](../done/20250706-ExifIFD.md) - Complete ExifIFD implementation with context tracking
- **Namespace Resolution**: [20250727-P10c-gps-ifd-parsing-bug.md](../done/20250727-P10c-gps-ifd-parsing-bug.md) - Namespace-aware storage architecture 
- **Subdirectory Coverage**: [P10b-subdirectory-coverage-expansion.md](P10b-subdirectory-coverage-expansion.md) - Configuration generation for missing modules
- **ExifTool source**: `third-party/exiftool/lib/Image/ExifTool/Exif.pm` lines 6174-7128 (ProcessExif with dynamic table switching)

### Prerequisites

- **Knowledge assumed**: Understanding of completed ExifIFD/GPS IFD architectures, ExifTool's dynamic tag table system, Rust namespace-aware HashMap patterns
- **Setup required**: Working IFD test suite, `make compat` environment, test images demonstrating context bugs

**Context Quality Check**: Can a new engineer understand WHY this is edge case debugging on mature architecture rather than greenfield development?

## Work Completed

- ✅ **ExifIFD Architecture (June 2025)** → Complete implementation with group assignment, context tracking, API compatibility, and comprehensive test infrastructure
- ✅ **GPS IFD Namespace Resolution (July 2025)** → Major architectural breakthrough implementing `HashMap<(u16, String), TagValue>` storage to prevent tag collisions  
- ✅ **Sophisticated Context System** → IFD context stack management, recursion prevention, manufacturer signature detection across 14+ implementations
- ✅ **Subdirectory Processing Pipeline** → Generic processing with condition evaluation, binary data extraction, and 51% Canon coverage demonstrating effectiveness
- ✅ **Configuration Status Verified (August 3, 2025)** → DNG_pm, Exif_pm, and JPEG_pm configurations all exist with working tag kits
- ✅ **Sony TAG_PREFIX Mechanism (August 3, 2025)** → Sony tags correctly show as "Sony_0x2000", "Sony_0x9001" etc. - TAG_PREFIX working as expected

## Remaining Tasks

**REQUIRED**: Each task must have a unique alphabetic ID (A, B, C, etc.), be actionable, and include success criteria with specific proof requirements.

### Task A: Fix ExifIFD Context Assignment Bug

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] **ColorSpace Context Fixed**: ColorSpace (0xA001) shows group1="ExifIFD" instead of group1="Canon"
- [ ] **Test Validation**: `cargo t test_color_space_validation` and `cargo t test_mandatory_exif_ifd_tags` pass
- [ ] **ExifTool Compatibility**: `exiftool -G1 -ColorSpace test-images/canon/eos_rebel_t3i.jpg` shows "[ExifIFD]" matching our group1
- [ ] **No Regressions**: All other ExifIFD and manufacturer tests continue passing

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- **ExifIFD Processing Confirmed**: Tag 0x8769 correctly maps to "ExifIFD" in `src/exif/processors.rs:304-306`
- **Context Override Issue**: ColorSpace gets processed in Canon MakerNotes context instead of ExifIFD context
- **Processing Order**: Need to investigate if ExifIFD subdirectory processing happens after Canon processing

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. **Investigate Context Precedence**: Check if Canon MakerNotes processing overrides ExifIFD context for ColorSpace
2. **Fix Context Assignment**: Ensure ExifIFD tags maintain ExifIFD context regardless of manufacturer processing order
3. **Validate Tag Source Priority**: ColorSpace should come from ExifIFD subdirectory, not manufacturer context

**Technical Details**:
- **ExifTool Reference**: `lib/Image/ExifTool/Exif.pm` ExifIFD subdirectory processing  
- **Key Files**: `src/exif/processors.rs` (subdirectory processing), `src/exif/tags.rs` (context assignment)
- **Investigation Required**: Context assignment timing and precedence rules

**Dependencies**: None - builds on existing ExifIFD infrastructure

### Task B: Validate All ExifIFD Tags Have Correct Context

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] **Comprehensive Testing**: All ExifIFD-specific tags (ExifVersion, FlashpixVersion, ExifImageWidth, etc.) show group1="ExifIFD"
- [ ] **Integration Verification**: `cargo t exif_ifd_validation_tests` passes completely
- [ ] **Cross-Manufacturer Testing**: ExifIFD context correct for Canon, Nikon, Sony, and other manufacturers
- [ ] **Regression Prevention**: No existing functionality broken by context fixes

**Approach**: Systematic validation of all ExifIFD tags to ensure consistent context assignment
**Dependencies**: Task A (ColorSpace context fix provides pattern for other ExifIFD tags)

### Task C: Update TPP Documentation Status

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] **Accurate Claims**: Remove all false claims about missing configurations and Sony issues
- [ ] **Current Status**: Document actual test failures and their root causes
- [ ] **Clear Focus**: TPP focuses on real ExifIFD context assignment issue
- [ ] **Future Guidance**: Provide accurate context for future engineers

**Approach**: Complete rewrite of TPP based on validation findings
**Dependencies**: Tasks A-B (understanding of actual technical issues)

## TDD Foundation Requirement

### Task 0: Integration Test (conditional)

**Required for**: Feature development (ExifIFD context assignment fix)

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] **Test exists**: `cargo t test_color_space_validation` demonstrates the problem and validates the fix
- [ ] **Test fails**: Currently fails with ColorSpace showing group1="Canon" instead of "ExifIFD"
- [ ] **Integration focus**: Test validates end-to-end context assignment behavior
- [ ] **TPP reference**: Test includes comment linking to P15 TPP
- [ ] **Measurable outcome**: Test passes when ExifIFD context assignment is fixed

The existing ExifIFD validation tests serve as our integration tests for this TPP.

## Integration Requirements

**CRITICAL**: Building without integrating is failure. Don't accept tasks that build "shelf-ware."

Every feature must include:
- [ ] **Activation**: Fixed context assignment and new configurations used automatically in default processing
- [ ] **Consumption**: Existing metadata extraction pipeline benefits from improved IFD parsing immediately
- [ ] **Measurement**: Can prove improvements via `make compat` success rate increases and specific test case resolutions
- [ ] **Cleanup**: Context assignment edge cases eliminated, configuration gaps filled, debugging aids removed from production code

**Red Flag Check**: If this seems like "fix edge cases but don't validate end-to-end impact," ask for clarity. We're improving metadata extraction completeness for PhotoStructure's production workflows.

## Working Definition of "Complete"

*Use these criteria to evaluate your own work - adapt to your specific context:*

A feature is complete when:
- ✅ **System behavior changes** - More metadata tags extracted successfully from real image files, fewer context assignment failures
- ✅ **Default usage** - IFD parsing improvements benefit all metadata extraction automatically, not opt-in fixes
- ✅ **Old path removed** - Context assignment bugs eliminated, missing configuration gaps filled
- ❌ Code exists but isn't used *(example: "context fixes implemented but tests still failing")*
- ❌ Feature works "if you call it directly" *(example: "new configurations exist but aren't integrated into main pipeline")*

*Note: These are evaluation guidelines, not literal requirements for every task.*

## Prerequisites

- **Dependency 1**: Existing ExifIFD architecture (completed 20250706) → validate with ExifIFD test suite
- **Dependency 2**: GPS IFD namespace resolution (completed 20250727) → validate with GPS coordinate extraction
- **Dependency 3**: Subdirectory processing pipeline (operational) → validate with Canon implementation showing 51% coverage

## Testing

- **Unit**: Test IFD context assignment with isolated ExifIFD, GPS IFD, and manufacturer subdirectory scenarios
- **Integration**: Verify end-to-end metadata extraction improvements with representative files from each manufacturer
- **Manual check**: Run `make compat` and confirm measurable success rate improvements from baseline 39% (66/167 tags)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] ExifIFD context assignment fixed: ColorSpace (0xA001) shows group1="ExifIFD" instead of group1="Canon"
- [ ] ExifIFD validation tests pass: `cargo t test_color_space_validation` and `cargo t test_mandatory_exif_ifd_tags` succeed
- [ ] `make precommit` clean with no regressions in manufacturer processing
- [ ] ExifTool compatibility verified: Our group1 assignments match ExifTool's -G1 output for ExifIFD tags
- [ ] All ExifIFD-specific tags (ExifVersion, FlashpixVersion, ExifImageWidth, etc.) correctly assigned to ExifIFD context

## Implementation Guidance

### Recommended Patterns

- **Context Debugging**: Use existing IFD context tracking infrastructure, focus on timing of context assignment vs manufacturer processing
- **Configuration Generation**: Leverage proven `auto_config_gen.pl` used successfully for Pentax, Matroska, MIE, and Jpeg2000 modules
- **Namespace Validation**: Build on GPS IFD success patterns that resolved tag ID collision architecture

### Tools to Leverage

- **Existing test infrastructure**: Comprehensive ExifIFD test suite, GPS IFD validation, manufacturer-specific test coverage
- **Configuration tools**: Working `auto_config_gen.pl` and `subdirectory_discovery.pl` for coverage analysis
- **Comparison validation**: `make compat` system for measuring tag extraction improvements

### ExifTool Translation Notes

- **Dynamic Tag Table Switching**: ExifTool's `TagTable => 'Image::ExifTool::GPS::Main'` patterns require precise timing in context assignment
- **ProcessExif Context**: Study lines 6174-7128 in Exif.pm for dynamic table pointer management during subdirectory processing  
- **Subdirectory Dispatch**: Understand how ExifTool maintains context across complex manufacturer subdirectory chains

## Clear Application for PhotoStructure

**Primary Motivation**: PhotoStructure users need complete metadata extraction from their image libraries. Current 39% success rate means 61% of critical metadata (GPS coordinates, lens information, camera settings) is missing from PhotoStructure's database, reducing search effectiveness and user satisfaction.

**Specific Impact**:
- **GPS Location Data**: Fix ExifIFD context bugs to ensure GPS metadata appears correctly for photo mapping features
- **Camera/Lens Information**: Improved IFD parsing extracts complete camera and lens metadata for equipment-based searches
- **RAW File Support**: DNG module configuration enables metadata extraction from Adobe DNG and camera RAW files
- **Search Reliability**: Higher tag extraction success rate means PhotoStructure's search and filtering features find more relevant photos

**Business Context**: Photographers rely on metadata for organizing tens of thousands of photos. Missing metadata reduces PhotoStructure's value proposition and creates support burden from users asking why their GPS coordinates or lens information doesn't appear.

## Integration with Existing Work

### Builds On Completed Architecture
- **ExifIFD Foundation (20250706-ExifIFD.md)**: Uses sophisticated context tracking and group assignment system
- **GPS IFD Resolution (20250727-P10c)**: Leverages namespace-aware storage architecture that solved tag collision issues
- **Subdirectory Infrastructure**: Extends proven subdirectory processing pipeline demonstrated by Canon's 51% coverage

### Coordinates with Planned Work  
- **P10a-exif-required-tags.md**: Provides IFD parsing improvements needed to achieve 90%+ tag extraction goals
- **P10b-subdirectory-coverage-expansion.md**: Implements specific configurations identified as high-impact by coverage analysis
- **P16-MILESTONE-19-Binary-Data-Extraction.md**: Ensures proper IFD context for binary data extraction (previews, thumbnails)

### Avoids Duplication
This TPP focuses on **context assignment bug fixes** rather than architectural rebuilding. The sophisticated ExifIFD, GPS IFD, and namespace systems are preserved and extended, not replaced.

## Gotchas & Tribal Knowledge

**Format**: Surprise → Why → Solution (Focus on positive guidance)

- **ExifIFD tests failing doesn't mean architecture is broken** → Context assignment timing edge case → Debug context switching between ExifIFD and manufacturer processing
- **ColorSpace shows wrong group1** → Processing order allows manufacturer context to override ExifIFD context → Ensure ExifIFD context takes precedence for ExifIFD-specific tags
- **Context assignment seems fragile** → ExifTool's dynamic table switching requires precise timing → Study ProcessExif context management patterns in `third-party/exiftool/lib/Image/ExifTool/Exif.pm`
- **Sony TAG_PREFIX claims in old TPPs** → Sony tags already work correctly → Sony_0x2000, Sony_0x9001 etc. show properly, no "Tag_xxxx" issue found
- **Missing configuration claims in old TPPs** → Configurations actually exist → DNG_pm, Exif_pm, JPEG_pm all have working configs at `codegen/config/`
- **Large files hard to analyze** → ReadTool truncates >2000 lines → Split large modules like `src/exif/tags.rs` (387+ lines) into focused submodules

## Next Engineer Handoff - Critical Files & Context

### **Key Source Files Needing Attention**

**Primary Fix Location**:
- ✅ `src/exif/tags.rs:257` - `apply_conversions()` function - **FIXED** context parameter bug (added source_info parameter and checks both ifd_name and namespace)
- ✅ `src/exif/mod.rs:593` - **UPDATED** call site to pass source_info parameter  
- `src/exif/ifd.rs:75-100` - Sony MakerNotes signature detection with context assignment
- `tests/exif_ifd_context_tests.rs:25-50` - Failing tests that validate fixes
- `tests/exif_ifd_tests.rs:22-50` - Group assignment tests showing ColorSpace→Canon issue

**ExifTool Reference Points**:
- `third-party/exiftool/lib/Image/ExifTool/Exif.pm:6174-7128` - ProcessExif dynamic tag table switching
- `third-party/exiftool/lib/Image/ExifTool/Exif.pm:8825` - GPS SubDirectory TagTable definition
- `third-party/exiftool/lib/Image/ExifTool/GPS.pm:51-82` - GPS-specific tag table context

**Configuration Status**:
- **Missing**: No `codegen/config/DNG_pm/`, `Exif_pm/`, `JPEG_pm/` configs exist
- **Working Pattern**: `codegen/config/Canon_pm/tag_kit.json` shows successful implementation
- **Generation Tool**: `codegen/extractors/auto_config_gen.pl` proven with Pentax, Matroska, MIE, Jpeg2000

### **Immediate Tasks with Specific Success Criteria**

**Task 1 - Implement TAG_PREFIX Mechanism for Sony Unknown Tags**:
- ✅ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: Missing TAG_PREFIX mechanism - ExifTool auto-generates manufacturer prefixes for unknown tags
- ❌ **CURRENT STATUS**: 8 `MakerNotes:Tag_xxxx` entries should be `MakerNotes:Sony_0xxxxx` 
- **ExifTool Pattern**: `Image::ExifTool::Sony::Main` → `TAG_PREFIX = "Sony"` → unknown tag 0x2000 becomes `Sony_0x2000`
- **Implementation Required**: Add TAG_PREFIX field to tag tables and modify unknown tag name generation
- **Validation Commands**: 
  - `cargo run --bin exif-oxide third-party/exiftool/t/images/Sony.jpg | grep -c Tag_` should show 0 instead of 8
  - `cargo run --bin exif-oxide third-party/exiftool/t/images/Sony.jpg | grep Sony_0x` should show manufacturer-prefixed names
- **Target Files**: 
  - `src/exif/mod.rs:285-290` - Unknown tag name generation logic (add TAG_PREFIX support)
  - `src/implementations/sony/mod.rs` - Sony table definition (add TAG_PREFIX field)
  - Tag table trait/struct definitions (add TAG_PREFIX field)

**Task 2 - Generate DNG Configuration**:
- **Target**: Create `codegen/config/DNG_pm/tag_kit.json` (94 subdirs = 5% coverage increase)
- **Status**: Exif_pm config already exists, focus on DNG for RAW metadata support
- **Method**: `cd codegen && ./extractors/auto_config_gen.pl third-party/exiftool/lib/Image/ExifTool/DNG.pm > config/DNG_pm/tag_kit.json`
- **Validation**: `make codegen` succeeds, enables Adobe DNG and camera RAW metadata extraction

### **Status Update from August 1, 2025 Validation**

**✅ Major TPP Claims Validated**:
- Comprehensive validation of all major infrastructure claims against actual codebase state
- Discovered significant disconnect between documented status and actual working functionality
- Confirmed sophisticated IFD infrastructure is working correctly (GPS namespace resolution, ExifIFD context tracking)
- Verified subdirectory processing pipeline effectiveness with Canon's 51% coverage

**❌ Critical Documentation Errors Identified**: 
- ExifIFD tests are PASSING, not failing as claimed in Task 1
- Exif_pm configuration EXISTS, contrary to "Missing: No Exif_pm config" in Task 2 
- Most context assignment works correctly; Sony is specific edge case, not systemic issue

**✅ Confirmed Remaining Issues**:
- Sony namespace assignment bug: 8 `Tag_xxxx` entries instead of proper names
- DNG configuration missing for RAW metadata support
- Baseline success rate claims (39% / 66/167) require validation due to test execution issues

**🔍 Key Discovery**:
- Infrastructure is more complete than documented; remaining work is targeted fixes rather than major architectural changes

### **Refactoring Opportunities Identified**

**Priority 1 - Sony Namespace Fix** (Primary remaining task):
- Fix `create_tag_source_info()` in `src/exif/tags.rs:90-110` to preserve Sony namespace during subdirectory processing
- Root cause: Two-phase processing resets namespace from "Sony" to "MakerNotes" during subdirectory phase
- Pattern: Manufacturer-specific namespace preservation throughout processing pipeline

**Priority 2 - DNG Configuration Generation** (High-impact addition):
- Generate `codegen/config/DNG_pm/tag_kit.json` using proven `auto_config_gen.pl` methodology
- 94 subdirectories = 5% coverage increase for RAW metadata support
- Enables Adobe DNG and camera RAW file metadata extraction

**Priority 3 - Evidence-Based Edge Case Validation**:
- Systematic testing of claimed context issues (ColorSpace assignment, etc.) with actual test files
- Focus on verification rather than assumption-based fixes since ExifIFD tests are passing
- Document any confirmed edge cases for targeted resolution

**Priority 4 - Success Rate Baseline Establishment**:
- Fix `make compat` execution issues (truncation, timeout) to establish accurate current baseline
- Replace unverified 39% (66/167) claims with measured current state
- Document impact of Sony fix and DNG configuration on metadata extraction completeness

## Quick Debugging

Stuck? Try these:

1. `cargo run --bin exif-oxide third-party/exiftool/t/images/Sony.jpg | grep Tag_` - See current Sony namespace issue (8 entries)
2. `cargo run --bin exif-oxide third-party/exiftool/t/images/Sony.jpg | grep Sony` - Should show proper Sony tag names after fix  
3. `ls codegen/config/DNG_pm/` - Should exist after Task 2 completion
4. `cargo run --bin exif-oxide test-images/dng/sample.dng` - Should extract metadata after DNG config generation
5. `rg "create_tag_source_info" src/ -A 10 -B 5` - Find namespace assignment logic for Sony fix
6. `./codegen/extractors/auto_config_gen.pl third-party/exiftool/lib/Image/ExifTool/DNG.pm` - Generate DNG configuration
