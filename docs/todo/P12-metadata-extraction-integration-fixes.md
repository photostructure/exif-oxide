# Metadata Extraction Infrastructure Integration Fixes

## Project Overview

- **Goal**: Fix critical integration gaps preventing metadata extraction infrastructure from working at runtime, increasing tag extraction success from 39% to 70%+
- **Problem**: Sophisticated metadata extraction infrastructure exists (binary data parsers, tag kit generators, context systems) but runtime connections are broken due to compilation errors, stub functions, and disconnected components
- **Constraints**: Must preserve existing working Canon patterns, maintain ExifTool compatibility, fix in dependency order to avoid cascading failures

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDERS

If you read this document, you **MUST** read and follow [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) as well as [TRUST-EXIFTOOL.md](TRUST-EXIFTOOL.md):

- **Trust ExifTool** (Translate and cite references, but using codegen is preferred)
- **Ask clarifying questions** (Maximize "velocity made good")
- **Assume Concurrent Edits** (STOP if you find a compilation error that isn't related to your work)
- **Don't edit generated code** (read [CODEGEN.md](CODEGEN.md) if you find yourself wanting to edit `src/generated/**.*rs`)
- **Keep documentation current** (so update this TPP with status updates, and any novel context that will be helpful to future engineers that are tasked with completing this TPP. Do not use hyperbolic "DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT"/"GROUNDBREAKING PROGRESS" styled updates -- that causes confusion and partially-completed low-quality work)

**NOTE**: These rules prevent build breaks, data corruption, and wasted effort across the team. 

If you are found violating any topics in these sections, **your work will be immediately halted, reverted, and you will be dismissed from the team.**

Honest. RTFM.

## Context & Foundation

**REQUIRED**: Assume reader is unfamiliar with this domain. Provide comprehensive context.

### System Overview

- **Generated Code Infrastructure**: Comprehensive codegen system produces binary data parsers (`processing_binary_data.rs`), tag kit modules (`tag_kit/mod.rs`), and lookup tables - infrastructure is 80% complete but disconnected from runtime
- **Tag Kit Integration System**: Tag kit generators create subdirectory processor functions that should call binary data parsers and apply PrintConv conversions - currently most return `Ok(vec![])` stubs
- **Canon Reference Implementation**: Canon tag kit shows working pattern with actual processor calls (`process_canon_shotinfo`) but processors contain TODOs instead of real extraction
- **Context Assignment Pipeline**: Sophisticated namespace-aware storage system (`HashMap<(u16, String), TagValue>`) for handling GPS/EXIF/MakerNotes contexts - works for GPS but has edge cases for manufacturers

### Key Concepts & Domain Knowledge

- **Binary Data Parsers**: Generated from ExifTool's ProcessBinaryData tables, extract individual tags from raw byte arrays at specific offsets with format handling (int16s, int32u, etc.)
- **Tag Kit Integration**: Two-phase pattern where binary extraction produces raw Tag values, then PrintConv conversion produces human-readable strings (`ToneCurve: 28` → `ToneCurve: Standard`)
- **Subdirectory Processing**: Nested tag table processing where manufacturer-specific data (Canon MakerNotes) requires context-aware dispatcher to appropriate processor functions
- **PrintConv Pipeline**: Human-readable value conversion using lookup tables and conditional logic extracted from ExifTool modules

### Surprising Context

**CRITICAL**: Document non-intuitive aspects that aren't obvious from casual code inspection:

- **Infrastructure Exists But Disconnected**: Generated binary data parsers, tag kit integration functions, and lookup tables all exist and compile but aren't connected at runtime - this looks like missing features but is actually broken wiring
- **Canon Works Differently**: Canon subdirectory functions call real processors while all others return empty vectors - Canon is the working reference pattern, not an exception
- **Generated Code Modified**: Recent system changes stubbed out many tag kit functions with `Ok(vec![])` returns, breaking subdirectory processing for most manufacturers except Canon
- **Test Compilation Blocking**: Missing test helper methods prevent running any tests to validate fixes - must fix compilation before any functional work
- **Binary Data Exists But Unused**: Canon has generated `processing_binary_data.rs` with complete tag tables but tag kit functions contain TODOs instead of using them

### Foundation Documents

- **Working Canon Pattern**: `src/generated/Canon_pm/tag_kit/mod.rs` shows subdirectory functions calling processors (line ~7200+ `process_tag_0x4_subdirectory` → `process_canon_shotinfo`)
- **Generated Binary Data**: `src/generated/Canon_pm/processing_binary_data.rs` contains complete `PROCESSING_TAGS` HashMap with 15 tags (ToneCurve, Sharpness, etc.)
- **Codegen Infrastructure**: `codegen/config/Canon_pm/process_binary_data.json` shows working multi-table configuration, similar configs exist for Sony
- **ExifTool Reference**: `third-party/exiftool/lib/Image/ExifTool/Canon.pm` lines 5087+ (Processing table), 2851+ (ShotInfo table)

### Prerequisites

- **Knowledge assumed**: Understanding of Rust compilation, ExifTool ProcessBinaryData format, tag kit generation system
- **Setup required**: Working test environment, Canon CR2 test images, ExifTool reference installation for comparison

**Context Quality Check**: Can a new engineer understand WHY this is infrastructure integration work rather than missing features?

## Work Completed

- ✅ **ProcessBinaryData Pipeline** → Multi-table extraction system operational with Canon and Sony configs generating comprehensive binary data parsers
- ✅ **Tag Kit Generator Enhancement** → Automatic binary data parser detection and integration code generation working
- ✅ **Canon Infrastructure** → Generated parsers exist with complete tag coverage, subdirectory functions call processors
- ✅ **Sony Binary Data Generation** → 139 ProcessBinaryData tables extracted with BITMASK placeholder system for future P15c work

## Remaining Tasks

**REQUIRED**: Each task must be numbered, actionable, and include success criteria.

### 1. Task: Fix Test Compilation Errors

**Success Criteria**: `cargo test` compiles successfully, all test helper methods available, can run tests to validate fixes
**Approach**: Restore missing `add_test_tag` method on `ExifReader` and ensure test-helpers feature is properly enabled
**Dependencies**: None - must be completed first

**Success Patterns**:

- ✅ `cargo test --features test-helpers` compiles without errors
- ✅ Integration tests can access `ExifReader::add_test_tag()` method
- ✅ `cargo t` alias works as documented in CLAUDE.md

**Implementation Notes**: Check `.cargo/config.toml` alias and `Cargo.toml` feature configuration, likely need to restore test-only implementation methods.

### 2. Task: Connect Canon Binary Data to Tag Kit Functions

**Success Criteria**: Canon ShotInfo and Processing subdirectories extract individual tags like `AutoISO: On`, `ToneCurve: Standard` instead of TODOs and raw arrays
**Approach**: Replace TODO comments in `process_canon_shotinfo` with actual binary data extraction using existing `processing_binary_data.rs` parser
**Dependencies**: Task 1 (compilation fixed so can test changes)

**Success Patterns**:

- ✅ `process_canon_shotinfo` uses generated `PROCESSING_TAGS` HashMap for tag extraction
- ✅ Binary data values converted through PrintConv lookup tables to human-readable strings
- ✅ Canon CR2 files show `MakerNotes:AutoISO: On` instead of arrays or TODOs
- ✅ Two-phase pattern: binary extraction → PrintConv conversion → final tag values

**Implementation Strategy**: 
```rust
// In process_canon_shotinfo - replace TODOs with:
use crate::generated::Canon_pm::processing_binary_data::{CanonProcessingTable, PROCESSING_TAGS};
let table = CanonProcessingTable::new();
// Extract binary data using table format and offsets
// Apply PrintConv conversion using tag kit system
```

### 3. Task: Fix Context Assignment Edge Cases

**Success Criteria**: Sony tags show proper names (`SonyExposureTime`) not `Tag_xxxx`, ExifIFD ColorSpace shows "ExifIFD" context not "Canon"
**Approach**: Fix namespace assignment during subdirectory processing to preserve manufacturer context
**Dependencies**: Task 2 (working Canon pattern established for context testing)

**Success Patterns**:

- ✅ `cargo run --bin exif-oxide third-party/exiftool/t/images/Sony.jpg | grep -c Tag_` shows 0 instead of 8
- ✅ ExifIFD group assignment tests pass: `ColorSpace` assigned to "ExifIFD" not "Canon"
- ✅ Manufacturer namespace preserved throughout subdirectory processing chain

**Root Cause**: Two-phase processing (main IFD + subdirectories) resets namespace to "MakerNotes" instead of preserving "Sony"/"Canon" context.

### 4. Task: Generate Missing Module Configurations

**Success Criteria**: Exif, DNG, JPEG modules have working tag kit configurations, subdirectory coverage increases from 13% to 25%+
**Approach**: Use proven `auto_config_gen.pl` to generate configurations for high-impact zero-coverage modules
**Dependencies**: Tasks 1-3 (compilation and Canon pattern working to validate new configs)

**Success Patterns**:

- ✅ `codegen/config/Exif_pm/tag_kit.json` exists and generates working processors
- ✅ `make codegen` succeeds with new configurations
- ✅ Coverage report shows >25% implementation with actual tag extraction
- ✅ Generated subdirectory functions call processors instead of returning empty vectors

**High-Impact Targets**: Exif (122 subdirs = 6.5% coverage), DNG (94 subdirs = 5.0%), JPEG (64 subdirs = 3.4%) = 14.9% potential coverage increase.

### 5. Task: Validate End-to-End Metadata Extraction Improvements

**Success Criteria**: Tag extraction success rate increases from 39% (66/167) to 70%+ (117+/167), `make precommit` passes cleanly
**Approach**: End-to-end validation with representative manufacturer test files and ExifTool comparison
**Dependencies**: Tasks 1-4 (all integration fixes complete)

**Success Patterns**:

- ✅ `make compat` shows measurable improvement in tag extraction success rates
- ✅ Canon, Sony, and other manufacturer files show increased metadata extraction
- ✅ Binary data tags show human-readable values matching ExifTool exactly
- ✅ No regressions in GPS coordinates, ExifIFD tags, or existing functionality

## Implementation Guidance

### Recommended Patterns

- **Follow Canon Working Example**: Use `src/generated/Canon_pm/tag_kit/mod.rs` subdirectory function pattern for other modules
- **Two-Phase Integration**: Binary extraction → PrintConv conversion, proven in Canon manual implementations
- **Generated Code Usage**: Always use generated binary data parsers instead of manual TODO implementations

### Tools to Leverage

- **Existing Binary Data Parsers**: `src/generated/Canon_pm/processing_binary_data.rs` with complete tag tables and format information
- **Working Configurations**: `codegen/config/Canon_pm/process_binary_data.json` multi-table pattern for new module configs
- **Comparison Validation**: `cargo run --bin compare-with-exiftool` tool for ExifTool compatibility verification

### ExifTool Translation Notes

- **ProcessBinaryData Format**: ExifTool uses `Format => 'int16s'` with `First => 1` offset calculations - generated parsers handle this automatically
- **PrintConv Integration**: ExifTool applies PrintConv after binary extraction - maintain same two-phase pattern in Rust implementation
- **Context Preservation**: ExifTool's dynamic tag table switching requires careful namespace management during subdirectory processing

## Integration Requirements

**CRITICAL**: Building without integrating is failure. Don't accept tasks that build "shelf-ware."

Every feature must include:
- [ ] **Activation**: Generated binary data parsers actively used by tag kit functions instead of TODOs
- [ ] **Consumption**: Subdirectory processing produces human-readable tag values automatically  
- [ ] **Measurement**: Can prove improvements via ExifTool comparison and increased extraction success rate
- [ ] **Cleanup**: TODO stubs replaced with real extraction, empty vector returns eliminated

**Red Flag Check**: If generated parsers exist but aren't called, or if functions compile but return empty results, the integration is incomplete.

## Working Definition of "Complete"

A feature is complete when:
- ✅ **System behavior changes** - More individual metadata tags extracted from real image files, raw arrays converted to human-readable values
- ✅ **Default usage** - Binary data integration happens automatically during normal metadata extraction, not opt-in
- ✅ **Old path removed** - TODO stubs eliminated, empty vector returns replaced with actual processing
- ❌ Code exists but isn't used *(example: "binary data parsers generated but tag kit functions still have TODOs")*
- ❌ Feature works "if you call it directly" *(example: "binary parser works in isolation but isn't called by subdirectory functions")*

## Prerequisites

- **Compilation Environment** → Working Rust toolchain → verify with `cargo check`
- **Test Images** → Canon CR2, Sony RAW files → available in `../test-images/` directory  
- **ExifTool Reference** → Working ExifTool installation → verify with `exiftool --version`

## Testing

- **Unit**: Test binary data integration functions with known byte sequences and expected tag values
- **Integration**: Verify end-to-end extraction with Canon CR2 and Sony files showing individual tags instead of arrays
- **Manual check**: Run `cargo run --bin compare-with-exiftool ../test-images/Canon/RAW_CANON_EOS_7D.CR2` and confirm matching values

## Definition of Done

- [ ] `cargo test` compiles and passes completely
- [ ] `make precommit` clean with no compilation or test failures
- [ ] Canon MakerNotes show individual tags: `AutoISO: On`, `ToneCurve: Standard` (not arrays or TODOs)
- [ ] Sony tags show proper names: `SonyExposureTime` (not `Tag_xxxx`)
- [ ] Tag extraction success rate >70% via compatibility testing

## Gotchas & Tribal Knowledge

**Format**: Surprise → Why → Solution (Focus on positive guidance)

- **Generated binary parsers exist but aren't used** → Tag kit functions have TODOs instead of integration calls → Replace TODOs with generated parser usage following Canon pattern
- **Canon works but other manufacturers don't** → Canon subdirectory functions call processors, others return empty vectors → Use Canon `process_tag_0x4_subdirectory` as template for other modules
- **Infrastructure looks complete but runtime fails** → Generated code exists but connections are broken → Focus on integration points between binary parsers and tag kit functions
- **Sony/manufacturer tags show as Tag_xxxx** → Namespace assignment resets during subdirectory processing → Preserve manufacturer context throughout processing chain
- **Tests won't compile** → Missing test helper methods block all validation → Fix compilation first before any functional work
- **Binary data shows arrays not individual tags** → Two-phase pattern incomplete - binary extraction without PrintConv conversion → Ensure both phases: extraction → conversion

## Quick Debugging

Stuck? Try these:

1. `cargo test --features test-helpers` - Check if compilation issues are resolved
2. `rg "process_canon_shotinfo" src/generated/Canon_pm/tag_kit/mod.rs -A 20` - See working Canon processor call pattern
3. `ls src/generated/Canon_pm/*.rs | grep binary_data` - Verify generated binary data parsers exist
4. `cargo run --bin exif-oxide ../test-images/Canon/RAW_CANON_EOS_7D.CR2 | grep -c TODO` - Should show 0 after fixes
5. `rg "Ok\(vec!\[\]\)" src/generated/*/tag_kit/mod.rs` - Find stub functions that need real processor calls
