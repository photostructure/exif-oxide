# Manufacturer MakerNotes Binary Data Extraction

## Project Overview

- **Goal**: Complete binary data extraction for all major camera manufacturers' MakerNotes to extract individual tag values (MacroMode, Quality, LensType, etc.) instead of raw byte arrays
- **Problem**: Only Canon MakerNotes binary data extraction is implemented; 20+ other manufacturers show subdirectory tags as arrays instead of individual meaningful values
- **Critical Constraints**:
  - ‚ö° Each manufacturer has proprietary MakerNotes format requiring custom parsers
  - üîß Binary data table structures vary significantly between manufacturers  
  - üìê Must maintain ExifTool compatibility for tag-for-tag output matching
  - üéØ Focus on high-impact tags (>80% usage) rather than comprehensive coverage

## MANDATORY READING

These are relevant, mandatory, prerequisite reading for every task:

- [@CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)
- [@docs/TRUST-EXIFTOOL.md](../TRUST-EXIFTOOL.md)

## DO NOT BLINDLY FOLLOW THIS PLAN

Building the wrong thing (because you made an assumption or misunderstood something) is **much** more expensive than asking for guidance or clarity.

The authors tried their best, but also assume there will be aspects of this plan that may be odd, confusing, or unintuitive to you. Communication is hard!

**FIRSTLY**, follow and study **all** referenced source and documentation. Ultrathink, analyze, and critique the given overall TPP and the current task breakdown.

If anything doesn't make sense, or if there are alternatives that may be more optimal, ask clarifying questions. We all want to drive to the best solution and are delighted to help clarify issues and discuss alternatives. DON'T BE SHY!

## KEEP THIS UPDATED

This TPP is a living document. **MAKE UPDATES AS YOU WORK**. Be concise. Avoid lengthy prose!

**What to Update:**

- üîç **Discoveries**: Add findings with links to source code/docs (in relevant sections)
- ü§î **Decisions**: Document WHY you chose approach A over B (in "Work Completed")
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Surprises**: Note unexpected behavior or assumptions that were wrong (in "Gotchas")
- ‚úÖ **Progress**: Move completed items from "Remaining Tasks" to "Work Completed"
- üöß **Blockers**: Add new prerequisites or dependencies you discover

**When to Update:**

- After each research session (even if you found nothing - document that!)
- When you realize the original approach won't work
- When you discover critical context not in the original TPP
- Before context switching to another task

**Keep the content tight**

- If there were code examples that are now implemented, replace the code with a link to the final source.
- If there is a lengthy discussion that resulted in failure or is now better encoded in source, summarize and link to the final source.
- Remember: the `ReadTool` doesn't love reading files longer than 500 lines, and that can cause dangerous omissions of context.

The Engineers of Tomorrow are interested in your discoveries, not just your final code!

## Background & Context

### Why This Work is Needed

Camera manufacturers embed proprietary binary data in MakerNotes containing critical metadata like:
- **Camera Settings**: MacroMode, Quality, ISO settings, flash modes
- **Lens Information**: LensType, focal length, aperture data
- **Image Processing**: White balance, color correction, sharpness settings
- **Technical Data**: Focus points, metering modes, exposure compensation

Currently, only Canon MakerNotes extract individual values. All other manufacturers show raw arrays:
```json
// Current (broken):
"MakerNotes:NikonCameraSettings": [1, 0, 3, 2, ...]

// Desired (ExifTool-compatible):
"MakerNotes:MacroMode": "Normal",
"MakerNotes:Quality": "RAW",
"MakerNotes:LensType": "AF-S DX VR Zoom-Nikkor 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G"
```

## Remaining Tasks

### üìä RESEARCH NEEDED: Tag Popularity Analysis

**Goal**: Determine which specific binary data tags have >80% usage across manufacturers to prioritize implementation effort.

**Research Questions**:
1. Which individual MakerNotes tags appear in >80% of real-world images?
2. Which tags are critical for image extraction (PreviewImage, ThumbnailImage)?
3. What's the cost/benefit ratio of full MakerNotes vs targeted tag extraction?

**Success Criteria**: 
- Quantified list of high-impact tags by manufacturer
- Implementation priority matrix based on usage data
- Clear recommendation on scope limitation

**Implementation Notes**: Use `docs/tag-metadata.json` analysis + ExifTool frequency data from large image datasets.

## Prerequisites

1. **P11 Canon Success Validation** - Ensure Canon implementation is stable and serves as architectural template
2. **Tag Popularity Research** - Complete usage analysis before prioritizing manufacturers
3. **ExifTool Source Analysis** - Deep understanding of manufacturer-specific modules in ExifTool codebase

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Binary data table extraction for each manufacturer
- Format parser validation with real camera files
- Tag kit integration testing

### Integration Tests
- Real camera file processing for top 3 manufacturers
- ExifTool compatibility validation using `compare-with-exiftool` tool
- Performance regression testing with large image datasets

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Validate manufacturer-specific extraction
cargo run --bin exif-oxide -- test-images/nikon/D850.NEF | grep "MakerNotes:MacroMode"
cargo run --bin exif-oxide -- test-images/sony/A7R4.ARW | grep "MakerNotes:Quality"

# Compare with ExifTool
./scripts/compare-with-exiftool.sh test-images/nikon/D850.NEF MakerNotes:
```

## Success Criteria & Quality Gates

### Definition of Done
1. **Top 3 Manufacturers**: Canon ‚úÖ, Nikon, Sony extract individual MakerNotes tags
2. **ExifTool Compatibility**: Tag-for-tag output matching using comparison tools
3. **Tag Coverage**: All high-impact tags (>80% usage) implemented per manufacturer
4. **Architecture**: Scalable pattern allowing easy addition of remaining manufacturers

### Quality Gates
- `make precommit` passes for all manufacturers
- ExifTool compatibility tests pass with <5% differences
- Performance impact <10% vs current implementation
- Documentation updated with manufacturer-specific gotchas

## Gotchas & Tribal Knowledge

### Manufacturer-Specific Challenges

**Nikon**:
- **Encryption**: Some MakerNotes tags are encrypted with camera-specific keys
- **Version Fragmentation**: Multiple MakerNotes versions across camera generations
- **Key Management**: Encryption keys stored in separate tags, must be extracted first

**Sony**:
- **Format Evolution**: Different binary formats for Alpha vs FX vs older cameras
- **Endianness Issues**: Some Sony models use mixed endianness within same MakerNotes
- **Model Detection**: Binary format depends on specific camera model detection

**Olympus**:
- **Nested Structures**: Heavy use of nested subdirectories within MakerNotes
- **Compressed Data**: Some binary data is compressed, requiring decompression

### Architecture Decisions

**Why Not Full Implementation**: 
- Each manufacturer requires 2-4 weeks of research + implementation
- 21 manufacturers √ó 3 weeks = 63 weeks of work for diminishing returns
- Focus on high-impact tags provides 90% of user value with 20% of effort

**Why Tag Kit Pattern**:
- Proven successful with Canon implementation
- Maintains ExifTool compatibility through generated code
- Scales to multiple manufacturers with shared infrastructure

**Technical Debt**:
- Manual format parsers will need maintenance as new camera models release
- Binary data extraction configs require updates with new ExifTool versions
- Encryption key management for Nikon will need secure storage consideration

### Performance Considerations

- Binary data processing adds ~15% overhead vs array extraction
- Memory usage increases with number of individual tags extracted
- Consider lazy evaluation for rarely-used manufacturer tags
