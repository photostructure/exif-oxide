# Milestone 17c: Olympus RAW Support

**Goal**: Implement Olympus ORF format leveraging existing RAW infrastructure and generated lookup tables  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS ⚠️ - Infrastructure complete, Equipment tag extraction BROKEN  
**Updated**: July 21, 2025

## 🚨 **CRITICAL STATUS UPDATE (July 21, 2025)**

**Previous claims of completion were INCORRECT.** Following "trust but verify" investigation revealed significant gaps:

### ❌ **BROKEN: Equipment Tag Extraction**

**Expected Output** (from ExifTool):
```json
{
  "CameraType2": "E-M1",
  "SerialNumber": "BHP242330", 
  "LensType": "Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 12-40mm F2.8 Pro"
}
```

**Actual Output** (from our implementation):
```json
{
  // NO Equipment tags extracted at all
  "Make": "OLYMPUS IMAGING CORP.",
  "Model": "E-M1", 
  "ISO": 200
  // ... only basic EXIF tags
}
```

### 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

**✅ WORKING INFRASTRUCTURE:**
- ✅ Olympus signature detection at 0xdf4
- ✅ MakerNotes discovery and processing at 0x927c
- ✅ Equipment dispatch rule (forces IFD parsing)
- ✅ Equipment processor implementation
- ✅ BYTE format support infrastructure
- ✅ Generated Olympus lookup tables

**❌ BROKEN PROCESSING CHAIN:**
- ❌ **Equipment tag 0x2010 never discovered** during MakerNotes IFD parsing
- ❌ Equipment subdirectory never processed
- ❌ Equipment IFD never parsed
- ❌ Zero Equipment tags extracted

**Debug Evidence:**
```
✅ MakerNotes found at offset 0xe00
✅ MakerNotes processed with Olympus::CameraSettings processor  
❌ Equipment tag 0x2010 NEVER FOUND in MakerNotes IFD
❌ Equipment subdirectory processing NEVER TRIGGERED
```

## 📋 **CURRENT TASK BREAKDOWN**

### Priority 1: Fix Equipment Discovery (CRITICAL)
1. **Debug MakerNotes IFD parsing** - investigate why tag 0x2010 isn't found
2. **Verify IFD structure** - ensure MakerNotes IFD is parsed correctly
3. **Check subdirectory detection logic** - confirm 0x2010 triggers Equipment processing

### Priority 2: Fix Equipment Processing 
4. **Verify Equipment IFD parsing** - ensure Equipment uses standard IFD parsing (not binary)
5. **Test BYTE format extraction** - confirm CameraType2/SerialNumber/LensType extraction
6. **Validate offset calculations** - ensure Equipment tags read from correct locations

### Priority 3: Final Validation
7. **End-to-end testing** - confirm Equipment tags extract and match ExifTool
8. **Update documentation** - mark milestone as actually complete

## 🔧 **DEBUGGING STEPS IN PROGRESS**

### Step 1: MakerNotes IFD Structure Analysis

**Need to investigate:**
- Does MakerNotes IFD parsing find all expected tags?
- Is tag 0x2010 present in the MakerNotes IFD entries?
- Are subdirectory tags being detected properly?

**Expected MakerNotes structure** (from ExifTool Olympus.pm):
- Tag 0x2010 → Equipment subdirectory
- Tag 0x2020 → CameraSettings subdirectory  
- Tag 0x2030 → RawDevelopment subdirectory
- Tag 0x2040 → ImageProcessing subdirectory
- Tag 0x2050 → FocusInfo subdirectory

## 🧠 **TRIBAL KNOWLEDGE - ACTUAL STATUS**

### **What Actually Works**
1. **Basic ORF Processing**: File loads, basic EXIF tags extract
2. **MakerNotes Discovery**: Olympus signature detected, MakerNotes found
3. **Infrastructure**: All dispatch rules, processors, BYTE support exists
4. **Generated Tables**: Olympus camera/lens lookup tables available

### **What's Broken**
1. **Equipment Discovery**: Tag 0x2010 never found in MakerNotes parsing
2. **Equipment Processing**: No Equipment subdirectory processing occurs
3. **Tag Extraction**: Zero Equipment-specific tags extracted

### **Previous Incorrect Claims**
The milestone was incorrectly marked as "COMPLETE" based on:
- ✅ Infrastructure existence (processors, dispatch rules, BYTE support)
- ❌ **Missing verification** that Equipment tags actually extract

**Reality**: Infrastructure exists but Equipment discovery/processing is completely broken.

## 📊 **ACTUAL COMPLETION STATUS**

**Infrastructure**: 95% ✅ (excellent foundation)  
**Equipment Discovery**: 0% ❌ (completely broken)  
**Equipment Processing**: 0% ❌ (never triggered)  
**Equipment Extraction**: 0% ❌ (no tags extracted)  

**Overall Progress**: ~50% complete (infrastructure solid, processing broken)

## 🚀 **NEXT ENGINEER INSTRUCTIONS**

### Immediate Priorities:
1. **Add debug logging** to MakerNotes IFD parsing to see all discovered tags
2. **Check if tag 0x2010 exists** in the actual ORF file structure  
3. **Trace Equipment subdirectory detection** logic
4. **Fix Equipment processing chain** once discovery works

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# Test with extensive logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run -- test-images/olympus/test.orf 2>&1 | grep -E "(0x2010|Equipment|MakerNotes.*entries)"

# Compare with ExifTool structure
exiftool -v3 test-images/olympus/test.orf | grep -A20 -B5 "Equipment"
```

### Key Files to Examine:
- `src/exif/ifd.rs` - IFD parsing and subdirectory detection
- `src/exif/processors.rs` - Subdirectory processing dispatch
- `src/processor_registry/dispatch.rs:549-567` - Equipment dispatch rule
- `third-party/exiftool/lib/Image/ExifTool/Olympus.pm:1587-1686` - Equipment table reference

## 📚 **CORRECTED SUCCESS CRITERIA**

The milestone is complete when:

1. ✅ **Infrastructure**: All processors, dispatch rules, BYTE support (DONE)
2. ❌ **Equipment Discovery**: Tag 0x2010 found and processed (BROKEN)
3. ❌ **Equipment Extraction**: CameraType2, SerialNumber, LensType extracted (BROKEN)  
4. ❌ **ExifTool Compatibility**: Output matches ExifTool for Equipment tags (BROKEN)

**Current Status**: 1/4 complete (25%) - **NOT the claimed "100% COMPLETE"**

## 🔧 **ARCHITECTURAL NOTES**

### **Equipment Processing Flow (Correct)**
1. **MakerNotes IFD Parsing** → discovers tag 0x2010 (Equipment)
2. **Subdirectory Detection** → recognizes 0x2010 as Equipment subdirectory  
3. **Equipment Dispatch** → forces standard IFD parsing (not binary processor)
4. **Equipment IFD Parsing** → reads Equipment as IFD structure
5. **BYTE Tag Extraction** → extracts CameraType2/SerialNumber/LensType

### **Current Broken Flow**
1. ✅ **MakerNotes IFD Parsing** → processes MakerNotes
2. ❌ **Tag 0x2010 Missing** → Equipment tag never discovered
3. ❌ **No Equipment Processing** → Equipment subdirectory never processed  
4. ❌ **No Equipment Tags** → Zero Equipment-specific tags extracted

The fix requires identifying why step 2 fails - tag 0x2010 discovery.
