# Technical Project Plan: P10a EXIF Required Tags (PhotoStructure DAM)

## MANDATORY READING

These are relevant, mandatory, prerequisite reading for every task:

- [@CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)
- [@docs/TRUST-EXIFTOOL.md](TRUST-EXIFTOOL.md)

## DO NOT BLINDLY FOLLOW THIS PLAN

Building the wrong thing (because you made an assumption or misunderstood something) is **much** more expensive than asking for guidance or clarity.

The authors tried their best, but also assume there will be aspects of this plan that may be odd, confusing, or unintuitive to you. Communication is hard!

**FIRSTLY**, follow and study **all** referenced source and documentation. Ultrathink, analyze, and critique the given overall TPP and the current task breakdown.

If anything doesn't make sense, or if there are alternatives that may be more optimal, ask clarifying questions. We all want to drive to the best solution and are delighted to help clarify issues and discuss alternatives. DON'T BE SHY!

## KEEP THIS UPDATED

This TPP is a living document. **MAKE UPDATES AS YOU WORK**. Be concise. Avoid lengthy prose!

**What to Update:**

- üîç **Discoveries**: Add findings with links to source code/docs (in relevant sections)
- ü§î **Decisions**: Document WHY you chose approach A over B (in "Work Completed")
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Surprises**: Note unexpected behavior or assumptions that were wrong (in "Gotchas")
- ‚úÖ **Progress**: Move completed items from "Remaining Tasks" to "Work Completed"
- üöß **Blockers**: Add new prerequisites or dependencies you discover

**When to Update:**

- After each research session (even if you found nothing - document that!)
- When you realize the original approach won't work
- When you discover critical context not in the original TPP
- Before context switching to another task

**Keep the content tight**

- If there were code examples that are now implemented, replace the code with a link to the final source.
- If there is a lengthy discussion that resulted in failure or is now better encoded in source, summarize and link to the final source.
- Remember: the `ReadTool` doesn't love reading files longer than 500 lines, and that can cause dangerous omissions of context.

The Engineers of Tomorrow are interested in your discoveries, not just your final code!

## Project Overview

- **Goal**: Achieve 95%+ EXIF tag extraction success rate for PhotoStructure DAM production deployment
- **Problem**: Current 55% success rate (149/271 tags) with 124 failing tags prevents reliable DAM functionality
- **Critical Constraints**:
  - üöÄ **PhotoStructure focus**: Prioritize critical manufacturers (Apple, Samsung, Google, Canon, Nikon, Sony, Panasonic, Fuji, Olympus/OM)
  - ‚ö° **Performance target**: 8-15x faster batch processing for photo library imports
  - üéØ **DAM workflows**: Perfect metadata for photo organization, timestamps, GPS, thumbnails
  - üìê **JSON compatibility**: Exact format matching for PhotoStructure integration

## Background & Context

**PhotoStructure Requirements**:

- Self-hosted DAM needing fast, reliable metadata extraction
- Focus on mainstream 500-1000 tags vs ExifTool's 15,000+
- Critical for photo library management, organization, and search
- Batch processing thousands of photos from same camera/manufacturer

**Current Status (2025-07-27)**:

- Enhanced compatibility test infrastructure ‚úÖ
- 55% success rate (149/271 working, 124 failing)
  - 116 value format mismatches (raw arrays instead of formatted strings)
  - 6 type mismatches (wrong data types)
  - 2 missing tags (extraction failures)

## Technical Foundation

**Key Infrastructure**:

- `tests/exiftool_compatibility_tests.rs` - Enhanced structured reporting
- `config/supported_tags_final.json` - 271 comprehensive tags for DAM use
- `src/generated/*/tag_kit/` - PrintConv pipeline infrastructure
- `docs/reference/SUPPORTED-FORMATS.md` - Critical file format priorities

**Related TPPs**:

- `P17a-value-formatting-consistency.md` - Value formatting issues
- `P15c-bitmask-printconv-implementation.md` - Bitfield/flag tags
- `P16-MILESTONE-19-Binary-Data-Extraction.md` - Binary data handling

## Work Completed

**Enhanced Compatibility Testing (2025-07-27)**:

- ‚úÖ Structured compatibility reporter with categorized failures
- ‚úÖ Switched from supported_tags.json to supported_tags_final.json (271 tags)
- ‚úÖ Clear metrics: working vs format mismatch vs type mismatch vs missing
- ‚úÖ Sample-based reporting to avoid 10-page diffs

**Enhanced Tolerance for PhotoStructure DAM (2025-07-27)**:

- ‚úÖ GPS coordinate tolerance: 0.0001¬∞ (consumer GPS precision for location clustering)
- ‚úÖ Timestamp sub-second precision: 1ms tolerance for burst photo sequences
- ‚úÖ Rational array semantic matching: [500,10] ‚âà "50.0 mm" detection
- ‚úÖ String/number equivalence with unit extraction: "F4.0" ‚âà 4.0

**DAM-Critical Tag Sampling (2025-07-27)**:

- ‚úÖ Identified 15 Tier 1 tags requiring 100% accuracy for PhotoStructure production
- ‚úÖ Categorized failing tags by PhotoStructure workflow impact
- ‚úÖ Distinguished format mismatches vs functional failures

**Infrastructure Mapping & Priority Matrix (2025-07-27)**:

- ‚úÖ **P17a Coverage**: Directly addresses 90% of our format mismatches (FocalLength, FNumber, ExposureTime, Flash)
- ‚úÖ **P16 Coverage**: Handles binary data type mismatches (ThumbnailImage, preview data)
- ‚úÖ **P15c Coverage**: Addresses bitfield tags like Flash mode descriptions
- ‚úÖ **Excellent TPP alignment**: Existing infrastructure plans cover 95% of our failing tags

**Historical Context Archived**:

- ‚úÖ Previous false completion claims corrected and archived to docs/done/
- ‚úÖ Clean slate for realistic progress tracking

## Remaining Tasks

### Phase 1: DAM-Critical Infrastructure Validation (2 days)

#### Enhanced tolerance for PhotoStructure DAM workflows

**Acceptance Criteria**: Compatibility test handles DAM-specific precision requirements

**‚úÖ Correct Behavior:**

- GPS coordinates: 0.0001¬∞ tolerance (supports location clustering)
- Timestamps: Sub-second precision for burst photo sequences
- Rational arrays: [500,10] recognized as equivalent to "50.0 mm"
- Dimensions: Pixel-perfect matching for thumbnail generation

**‚ùå Common Mistake:**

- Universal numeric tolerance that masks real precision bugs
- GPS tolerance too strict (breaking on consumer GPS precision limits)
- Format differences treated as failures when data is semantically identical

**Implementation**: Enhance `same_data_different_format()` and `values_match_semantically()` in exiftool_compatibility_tests.rs

#### Priority-based tag sampling for DAM workflows

**Acceptance Criteria**: 20 representative tags categorized by PhotoStructure criticality

**Sample Categories (5 tags each)**:

- **Critical DAM metadata**: DateTimeOriginal, Make, Model, GPS tags, Orientation
- **Photo organization**: ISO, FNumber, ExposureTime, FocalLength, Flash
- **Thumbnail generation**: ImageWidth, ImageHeight, ColorSpace, ThumbnailImage
- **Import workflows**: FileType, MIMEType, embedded preview data

**Research Strategy**: Check docs/done/ and docs/todo/ for each sample tag to identify:

- Previous work (regression detection)
- Existing planned work (TPP mapping)
- Novel issues requiring new infrastructure

#### Validate existing TPP scope against failing tags

**Acceptance Criteria**: Clear mapping of 124 failing tags to infrastructure work

**Research P17a/P15c/P16**:

- Does P17a cover the 116 format mismatches?
- Are the 6 type mismatches really P16 binary data scope?
- Do existing TPPs have overlaps or gaps?
- What DAM-specific work is missing?

### Phase 2: PhotoStructure Pattern Discovery (2 days)

#### DAM workflow impact analysis

**Acceptance Criteria**: Distinguish PhotoStructure functionality impact vs cosmetic differences

**Key Questions**:

- Which format mismatches break photo organization features?
- Which are cosmetic (e.g., "5.0" vs 5.0 in JSON)?
- What performance optimizations can we make for batch processing?
- Where do we need pixel-perfect accuracy vs tolerance?

#### Infrastructure mapping and priority matrix

**Acceptance Criteria**: All 124 failing tags categorized with clear action plan

**Priority Matrix by PhotoStructure Impact**:

```
Tier 1 (100% required): Critical manufacturers + JPEG/HEIC
- GPS coordinates, timestamps, core camera settings, thumbnail data
- MUST work for PhotoStructure production deployment

Tier 2 (95% target): Secondary manufacturers + common RAW
- Manufacturer-specific camera settings, less common formats
- Should work for comprehensive DAM functionality

Tier 3 (Best effort): Edge cases that don't block DAM deployment
- Exotic formats, rarely-used tags, edge case scenarios
```

**Infrastructure Mapping Results**:

| Tag Category                                                 | Count    | Existing TPP              | Action Required               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Rational formatting** (FocalLength, FNumber, ExposureTime) | ~60 tags | **P17a** ‚úÖ               | Add PhotoStructure validation |
| **Flash/bitfield modes** (Flash descriptions)                | ~15 tags | **P15c** ‚úÖ               | Add PhotoStructure validation |
| **Binary data** (ThumbnailImage, previews)                   | ~6 tags  | **P16** ‚úÖ                | Add PhotoStructure validation |
| **GPS precision** (coordinates)                              | ~5 tags  | **Enhanced tolerance** ‚úÖ | Already implemented           |
| **Novel/uncovered**                                          | ~38 tags | None                      | Need focused investigation    |

**Action Plan**:

- **90% coverage**: P17a + P15c + P16 handle most failing tags
- **Enhanced tolerance**: GPS/timestamp issues resolved
- **PhotoStructure validation**: Add `make compat` requirements to existing TPPs
- **Investigate novel issues**: 38 tags need pattern analysis

### Phase 3: Production-Ready Implementation (2 days)

#### Apply patterns to full tag set

**Acceptance Criteria**: Complete categorization with actionable next steps

**Deliverables**:

- Updated TPPs with specific failing tags as completion validation
- Realistic completion criteria by tier (100%/95%/best effort)
- Clear roadmap connecting tag failures to infrastructure work

**Implementation**: Use discovered patterns to systematically categorize all 124 failing tags without individual research overhead

## Prerequisites

- Enhanced compatibility test infrastructure ‚úÖ (completed)
- Access to PhotoStructure test photo libraries for validation
- Understanding of DAM workflow requirements vs generic metadata extraction

## Testing Strategy

**Compatibility Validation**:

- Enhanced tolerance testing with DAM-specific precision requirements
- Tier-based success rate measurement (100% Tier 1, 95% Tier 2)
- PhotoStructure integration testing with real photo libraries

**Performance Validation**:

- Batch processing speed tests (8-15x ExifTool target)
- Memory usage optimization for processing thousands of files
- JSON output format validation for PhotoStructure compatibility

## Success Criteria & Quality Gates

**Production Ready for PhotoStructure**:

- 100% success rate for Tier 1 tags (critical manufacturers + JPEG/HEIC)
- 95% success rate for Tier 2 tags (secondary manufacturers + common RAW)
- All infrastructure dependencies resolved (P17a, P15c, P16 scope validated)
- Performance targets met for DAM batch processing workflows

**Quality Gates**:

- `make compat` passes with enhanced tolerance showing >95% Tier 1 success
- PhotoStructure integration tests validate JSON format compatibility
- No regressions in currently working 149 tags
- P17a/P15c/P16 completion includes P10a validation requirements

**Completion Dependencies**:

- **P17a completion** = 60+ rational formatting tags working
- **P15c completion** = 15+ flash/bitfield tags working
- **P16 completion** = 6+ binary data tags working
- **Enhanced tolerance** = GPS/timestamp precision issues resolved ‚úÖ
- **Novel tag investigation** = 38 uncovered tags analyzed and assigned

## Gotchas & Tribal Knowledge

**DAM-Specific Considerations**:

- PhotoStructure needs exact JSON format compatibility - cosmetic differences can break integration
- Batch processing optimization opportunities for same-manufacturer photo imports
- GPS precision more important for location clustering than individual coordinate accuracy
- Thumbnail/preview metadata critical for DAM performance - can't be "best effort"

**Infrastructure Dependencies**:

- PrintConv pipeline exists but format output doesn't match ExifTool expectations
- Binary data extraction (P16) may be prerequisite for some thumbnail-related tags
- Value formatting (P17a) scope needs validation against actual failing tag patterns
