# Technical Project Plan: Subdirectory Coverage Expansion

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Expand subdirectory coverage from 8.95% to 50%+ by systematically implementing missing condition patterns and manufacturer configurations.

**Problem Statement**: The subdirectory discovery tool found 1,865 SubDirectory patterns, but only 167 (8.95%) are implemented. This causes exif-oxide to output raw binary arrays instead of meaningful tags for most manufacturer-specific data.

## MANDATORY READING

These are relevant, mandatory, prerequisite reading for every task:

- [@CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)
- [@docs/TRUST-EXIFTOOL.md](../docs/TRUST-EXIFTOOL.md).

## DO NOT BLINDLY FOLLOW THIS PLAN

Building the wrong thing (because you made an assumption or misunderstood something) is **much** more expensive than asking for guidance or clarity.

The authors tried their best, but also assume there will be aspects of this plan that may be odd, confusing, or unintuitive to you. Communication is hard!

**FIRSTLY**, follow and study **all** referenced source and documentation. Ultrathink, analyze, and critique the given overall TPP and the current task breakdown.

If anything doesn't make sense, or if there are alternatives that may be more optimal, ask clarifying questions. We all want to drive to the best solution and are delighted to help clarify issues and discuss alternatives. DON'T BE SHY!

## KEEP THIS UPDATED

This TPP is a living document. **MAKE UPDATES AS YOU WORK**. Be concise. Avoid lengthy prose!

**What to Update:**

- 🔍 **Discoveries**: Add findings with links to source code/docs (in relevant sections)
- 🤔 **Decisions**: Document WHY you chose approach A over B (in "Work Completed")
- ⚠️ **Surprises**: Note unexpected behavior or assumptions that were wrong (in "Gotchas")
- ✅ **Progress**: Move completed items from "Remaining Tasks" to "Work Completed"
- 🚧 **Blockers**: Add new prerequisites or dependencies you discover

**When to Update:**

- After each research session (even if you found nothing - document that!)
- When you realize the original approach won't work
- When you discover critical context not in the original TPP
- Before context switching to another task

**Keep the content tight**

- If there were code examples that are now implemented, replace the code with a link to the final source.
- If there is a lengthy discussion that resulted in failure or is now better encoded in source, summarize and link to the final source.
- Remember: the `ReadTool` doesn't love reading files longer than 500 lines, and that can cause dangerous omissions of context.

The Engineers of Tomorrow are interested in your discoveries, not just your final code!

## Background & Context

### Why This Work Is Needed

- **Current State**: Only Canon (46.3%) and XMP (97.5%) have decent coverage
- **User Impact**: Raw arrays like `ColorData1: [10, 789, 1024, ...]` instead of `WB_RGGBLevelsAsShot: "2241 1024 1024 1689"`
- **Scale**: 1,698 missing subdirectories across 100+ modules
- **Infrastructure Ready**: Tag kit subdirectory support is 95% complete - just needs configs and enhanced parsing

pub struct SubdirectoryConditionEvaluator {
    regex_cache: HashMap<String, Regex>,
}

pub struct SubdirectoryContext {
    pub val_ptr: Option<Vec<u8>>,      // $$valPt binary data
    pub make: Option<String>,          // $$self{Make} 
    pub model: Option<String>,         // $$self{Model}
    pub format: Option<String>,        // Format conditions
    pub count: Option<usize>,          // Count conditions
    pub byte_order: ByteOrder,
    pub metadata: HashMap<String, TagValue>,
}

// Integration with tag kit dispatch
pub struct RuntimeSubdirectoryDispatcher {
    condition_evaluator: SubdirectoryConditionEvaluator,
}
```

**Coverage Impact:**
- Phase 3 enables dynamic runtime evaluation for complex subdirectory conditions
- Provides foundation for handling $$valPt patterns (common in Sony, Olympus)
- Supports $$self{Model/Make} patterns (common in Canon, Nikon)
- Ready for Phase 4 systematic expansion across all manufacturer modules
- Test coverage: 10 comprehensive tests covering all condition types

### Phase 5: Continuous Validation System [MEDIUM CONFIDENCE]

**Current State**: `make compat` provides foundation but gaps exist for subdirectory-specific validation

**Task 5.1: Enhanced ExifTool Compatibility Testing** [PARTIALLY SATISFIED]
- ✅ **Existing**: `make compat` generates ExifTool reference snapshots and compares values
- ✅ **Existing**: Tests against 20+ file formats with supported tags validation
- ❌ **Gap**: No subdirectory-specific validation - tests only top-level tag compatibility
- ❌ **Gap**: Missing validation for newly generated configs (XMP, IPTC, MWG, etc.)
- ❌ **Gap**: No automated detection of subdirectory parsing failures

**Task 5.2: Module-Specific Coverage Validation** [NOT SATISFIED]
- ❌ **Missing**: Per-module subdirectory extraction validation
- ❌ **Missing**: Automated testing of newly generated tag_kit configs  
- ❌ **Missing**: Validation that subdirectory conditions are being evaluated correctly
- ❌ **Missing**: Detection of stub functions that need implementation

**Task 5.3: Coverage Metrics Integration** [PARTIALLY SATISFIED]
- ✅ **Existing**: `make subdirectory-coverage` generates reports
- ❌ **Gap**: Coverage metrics not integrated into CI pipeline
- ❌ **Gap**: No regression detection for coverage decreases
- ❌ **Gap**: No tracking of required tag implementation progress

**Gap Analysis Summary:**

| Component | `make compat` Status | Phase 5 Requirement | Gap |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|-----|
| **ExifTool Comparison** | ✅ Comprehensive | Top-level tag validation | ❌ Subdirectory-specific validation |
| **File Format Coverage** | ✅ 20+ formats | Broad compatibility | ❌ New module validation |  
| **Value Normalization** | ✅ Handles formatting diffs | Accurate comparison | ❌ Binary subdirectory data |
| **Coverage Tracking** | ❌ None | Progress monitoring | ❌ CI integration |
| **Regression Detection** | ❌ None | Quality assurance | ❌ Automated alerts |
| **Module Testing** | ❌ None | Config validation | ❌ Auto-generated configs |

**Required Enhancements for Phase 5:**

1. **Subdirectory-Aware Testing**: Extend compatibility tests to validate subdirectory extraction
2. **Generated Config Validation**: Automatically test newly created tag_kit configurations  
3. **Coverage CI Integration**: Add coverage metrics to CI pipeline with failure thresholds
4. **Binary Data Validation**: Compare subdirectory binary parsing output with ExifTool
5. **Stub Function Detection**: Identify and track unimplemented subdirectory processors

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of tag kit architecture (see completed work)
- Familiarity with Perl regex syntax
- Access to test images from various manufacturers

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

```rust
#[test]
fn test_model_condition_parsing() {
    let condition = "$$self{Model} =~ /\\b(450D|REBEL XSi|Kiss X2)\\b/";
    let parsed = parse_subdirectory_conditions(condition);
    match parsed {
        SubdirectoryCondition::Model(pattern) => {
            assert_eq!(pattern.regex, "\\b(450D|REBEL XSi|Kiss X2)\\b");
            assert!(!pattern.negated);
        }
        _ => panic!("Expected model condition"),
    }
}
```

### Integration Tests

For each manufacturer:
1. Extract known subdirectory tag with ExifTool
2. Extract with exif-oxide
3. Compare values (must match exactly)

### Test Images

- Canon: Use existing T3i test (working baseline)
- Nikon: Need D7000, Z9 samples for CustomSettings

## Gotchas & Tribal Knowledge

### Condition Pattern Complexity

**The 80/20 Rule**: 80% of conditions are simple patterns we can handle at codegen time:
- Count comparisons: 40% of all conditions
- Model matches: 30% of conditions
- Format checks: 10% of conditions
- Complex expressions: 20% need runtime evaluation

### Sony's $$valPt Patterns

Sony uses binary signatures extensively. Key insight: These are checking magic bytes at data start:
- `^\xHH` checks first byte
- Character classes `[\\x01\\x02\\x10]` check for any of these bytes
- Often combined with model checks

### Negative Offsets

Already fixed, but remember: ExifTool uses negative offsets to reference from END of data. The fix in `tag_kit_modular.rs` handles this correctly with signed arithmetic.

### Performance Considerations

- Model regex matching: Cache compiled regexes
- Runtime evaluation: Only as last resort
- Condition checking: Happens once per tag extraction

### ExifTool Updates

Monthly ExifTool releases may add new patterns. Design for extensibility:
- Unknown patterns → runtime evaluation
- Log new patterns for future codegen support
- Maintain backward compatibility

## Risk Mitigation

### Complex Pattern Risk
- **Risk**: Some patterns too complex for simple parsing
- **Mitigation**: Runtime evaluation fallback
- **Monitoring**: Track runtime evaluation usage

### Performance Risk
- **Risk**: Runtime evaluation slows extraction
- **Mitigation**: Optimize common patterns at codegen
- **Measurement**: Benchmark before/after

### Test Coverage Risk
- **Risk**: Lack of test images for validation
- **Mitigation**: Community partnerships, gradual rollout
- **Validation**: ExifTool comparison on available images

## Implementation Order

1. **Start with Phase 1**: Enhanced parsing gives immediate value
2. **Nikon first in Phase 2**: Highest subdirectory count
3. **Sony for $$valPt patterns**: Proves runtime capability
4. **QuickTime for simple cases**: Quick wins
5. **Iterate based on user feedback**: Focus on real-world usage

This plan builds on the 95% complete subdirectory infrastructure to systematically expand coverage, focusing on pragmatic solutions that handle the majority of patterns while maintaining ExifTool compatibility.
