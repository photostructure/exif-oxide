# Technical Project Plan

Please create or update a Technical Project Plan that will allow a new engineer on our team to successfully continue your work.

These are also referred to as "technical design", "milestone", or "handoff" documents.

The doc should live in `${projectRoot}/docs/todo/${YYYYMMDD}-${short kebob-cased descriptive name}.md`

Be respectful of the next engineer's time:

- keep each section actionable and focused
- aim for bullet points or short paragraphs rather than lengthy prose
- avoid duplication between sections
- and aim for less than 500 lines
- Not all sections below may be relevant -- skip them and keep your doc focused!

## Document structure

This is general guidance

- if a section doesn't apply, omit it
- if there is content that doesn't fit in any of these sections, add a new section!

### Project Overview

- High-level goal
- Problem statement

### Background & Context

- Why this work is needed
- Links to related design docs

### Technical Foundation

- Key codebases
- Documentation
- APIs
- Systems to familiarize with

### Work Completed

- What has already been implemented
- Decisions made and rationale
- Issues resolved

### Remaining Tasks

- Tasks that have very high confidence can be listed directly with implementation instructions
- All other tasks should be clearly denoted as requiring additional research, analysis, and implementation design work. They may include possible implementation sketches if that could help illuminate the task better.

### Prerequisites

- Any additions or changes needed before starting work. Ideally, point to an existing TPP.

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Manual testing steps

### Success Criteria & Quality Gates

- How to know when work is complete
- Definition of done including required reviews

### Gotchas & Tribal Knowledge

- Known edge cases
- Technical debt
- Decision rationale
- Other insights to avoid pitfalls
