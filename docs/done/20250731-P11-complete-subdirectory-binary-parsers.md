# Complete SubDirectory Binary Data Parsers - SUPERSEDED

**STATUS**: This TPP has been **SUPERSEDED** by [P12-metadata-extraction-integration-fixes.md](../todo/P12-metadata-extraction-integration-fixes.md) after comprehensive investigation revealed broader scope.

## Project Status Summary (July 31, 2025)

**Research Findings**: The P11 investigation uncovered that the issue was not specifically "missing binary parsers" but rather **broken integration between existing infrastructure components**:

### ‚úÖ Infrastructure Found to Exist
- ProcessBinaryData pipeline operational with multi-table Canon and Sony configurations
- Generated binary data parsers exist (`processing_binary_data.rs`, `previewimageinfo_binary_data.rs`) 
- Tag kit integration code generated and compiles successfully
- Canon MakerNotes processing infrastructure working

### ‚ùå Runtime Integration Broken
- Most tag kit subdirectory functions return `Ok(vec![])` stubs instead of calling processors
- Canon binary processors contain TODOs instead of using generated parsers
- Test compilation errors block validation of any fixes
- Context assignment issues cause manufacturer tags to show as `Tag_xxxx`

### üéØ Root Cause Identified
This is **infrastructure integration work**, not missing features. The sophisticated binary data extraction system exists but connections are broken at multiple levels.

## Superseded by P12

**[P12-metadata-extraction-integration-fixes.md](../todo/P12-metadata-extraction-integration-fixes.md)** addresses the complete scope:

1. **Fix compilation errors** (blocking all testing)
2. **Connect binary data parsers to tag kit functions** (Canon pattern working but incomplete)
3. **Resolve context assignment edge cases** (Sony namespace issues, ExifIFD context bugs)
4. **Generate missing configurations** (Exif, DNG, JPEG modules)
5. **Validate end-to-end improvements** (70%+ extraction success rate)

## Key Insights for Future Work

- **Canon is the working reference**: Use Canon subdirectory patterns for other manufacturers
- **Generated code exists but unused**: Binary data parsers generated but tag kit functions have TODOs
- **Context issues are cross-cutting**: Affects both binary data extraction and manufacturer tag resolution
- **Dependency order critical**: Compilation ‚Üí Canon completion ‚Üí context fixes ‚Üí scaling

# Original P11 Content (For Reference)

## Project Overview

- **High-level goal**: Complete the implementation of subdirectory binary data parsers to properly extract individual tag values instead of raw byte arrays
- **Problem statement**: While subdirectory dispatcher functions now correctly call processor functions (fixed 2025-07-25), the actual binary data parsing implementations remain as TODOs, causing tags like ProcessingInfo and CanonShotInfo to display as numeric arrays instead of meaningful values
- **Root cause discovered (2025-07-26)**: The issue is missing ProcessBinaryData pipeline infrastructure, not missing implementations. The `process_binary_data.pl` extractor exists but has never been configured or activated.
- **Critical constraints**:
  - ‚ö° Focus on embedded image extraction (PreviewImage, JpgFromRaw, ThumbnailImage, etc.) for CLI `-b` flag support
  - üîß Integrate with existing proven two-phase pattern (binary extraction ‚Üí tag kit PrintConv)
  - üìê Maintain compatibility with existing manual implementations during incremental migration
