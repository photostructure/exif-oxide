  Now I need to read the essential documentation as instructed. The document references several key files that I need to understand before starting work. Let me 
  create a todo list to track my research and then systematically read through all the referenced documentation.

  From the document, I need to read:

  1. CODEGEN.md - Universal code generation system architecture
  2. ARCHITECTURE.md - High-level system overview
  3. Other referenced docs to understand the context fully

  This is clearly a complex task involving fixing compilation errors related to the migration from legacy monolithic import patterns to a new flattened universal 
  extraction structure. The key issues seem to be:

  1. Critical string escape bug in codegen (highest priority blocker)
  2. Missing module declarations in generated/mod.rs
  3. Fixing MAIN_TAGS constant names across modules 
  4. Migrating *_pm import paths to new structure
  5. Replacing tag_kit function calls
  6. Investigating missing functions

  Let me start with creating a todo list to track my research and work, then read the essential docs.

  Now let me analyze the current compilation error state. Based on my research, I understand that:

  1. The project migrated from legacy monolithic import patterns to a new flattened universal extraction structure
  2. There's a critical string escape bug in the codegen that must be fixed first
  3. Several import-related issues need to be resolved

  Let me check the current compilation state.

✻ Thinking…

  I can see the errors, and they fall into several categories exactly as described in the P07 document:

  1. Missing module declarations - composite_tags and file_types modules not found in generated
  2. MAIN_TAGS constant name issues - modules looking for MAIN_TAGS but the constants have specific names like CANON_MAIN_TAGS
  3. *Legacy _pm imports - References to old module paths that no longer exist
  4. tag_kit:: function calls - References to tag_kit module that doesn't exist in new structure
  5. String escape issues - I don't see these in the output yet, but they may be hidden by the other errors

  Let me first check what's in the generated/mod.rs file to see what modules are missing.

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! I've completed the research phase and analyzed the current compilation errors. I can see exactly what the P07 document was talking about. The errors 
  show:

  1. 240 compilation errors - this is a significant number, likely due to cascading import failures
  2. 634 warnings - these are likely due to unused code and other issues that arise from broken imports

  The errors break down as expected:

  1. Missing modules in generated/mod.rs - composite_tags and file_types modules not found
  2. MAIN_TAGS constant naming - Many modules looking for generic MAIN_TAGS but constants have specific names
  3. tag_kit:: references - Legacy function calls that don't exist in new structure
  4. *Some legacy _pm imports - Though I didn't see many of these in the first batch

  Based on the P07 document's guidance, I should start with the highest priority blocker first - checking for the string escape bug in the codegen. However, I 
  should first check what's in generated/mod.rs and see if the missing modules are actually present but not declared.

  Let me examine the generated/mod.rs file to understand what modules exist but aren't being exported.

● Based on my comprehensive research and current error analysis, I can see we have 240 compilation errors and 634 warnings. The errors are exactly what the P07
  document predicted:

  1. Missing module declarations - composite_tags and file_types not found in generated
  2. MAIN_TAGS constant naming issues - 29+ modules looking for generic MAIN_TAGS but constants have specific names
  3. Legacy tag_kit:: function calls - References to non-existent tag_kit module
  4. Some legacy import paths - Various broken import references

✻ Thinking…

  I can see that composite_tags and file_types modules are missing from the generated/mod.rs file. Let me check if these directories exist in the generated folder:

● Perfect! I can see the issue clearly. Let me check what modules actually exist in the generated directory:

● List(src/generated)

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! I can see that both composite_tags.rs and file_types/ directory exist in the generated folder, but they're not declared in the generated/mod.rs file. 
  This is Task B exactly as described in the P07 document.

  Now let me start working on the fixes in the order specified by the P07 document. However, first I should look at the critical string escape bug mentioned as the
   Priority 1 blocker. Let me check if we can see evidence of string escape errors by looking at one of the generated files that might contain PrintConv 
  expressions.

  Let me first tackle Task B (missing module declarations) since it's clear and will help us see more errors, then look for the string escape bug.

● Perfect! I can see that both composite_tags.rs and the file_types/ directory exist in the generated folder, but they're missing from the generated/mod.rs file.
  This is exactly Task B from the P07 document.

  Let me start with the critical fixes in priority order. Let me first tackle Task B (missing module declarations) since this is straightforward and will help
  reveal more errors:

✻ Thinking…

  I'll start with Task B - adding the missing module declarations to generated/mod.rs. I can see that composite_tags.rs and file_types/ directory exist but aren't 
  declared in the mod.rs file.

  However, I need to be careful about the supported_tags reference on line 44-48 which seems to be problematic. Let me first add the missing module declarations 
  and fix the broken supported_tags import.

> make sure you don't directly edit generated code! fix codegen instead.

● You're absolutely right! I was about to make the cardinal mistake mentioned in CLAUDE.md:

  5. DO NOT EDIT THE FILES THAT SAY DO NOT EDIT

  Everything in src/generated is generated code -- if you edit the file directly, the next time make codegen is run, your edit will be deleted. Fix the generating 
  code in codegen/src instead.
  YOU WILL BE IMMEDIATELY FIRED IF YOU IGNORE THIS WARNING

  I need to fix the codegen system that generates src/generated/mod.rs, not edit the generated file directly. Let me examine the codegen system to understand how
  it generates the module declarations.

● Read(codegen/src/strategies/mod.rs)
  ⎿  Read 515 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! I can see the issue. In the update_main_mod_file method at lines 384-391, the code checks if file_types and supported_tags exist, but it's checking for
  the wrong paths. Let me examine what actually exists and what the issue is:

● List(src/generated/file_types)
  ⎿  Listed 7 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(src/generated/composite_tags.rs)
  ⎿  Read 10 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Great! Both composite_tags.rs and file_types/ directory with mod.rs exist, but the current generated mod.rs is missing the declarations. Looking at the codegen
  logic:

  1. Lines 384-388: It only adds file_types and supported_tags if specific directories/files exist
  2. It doesn't handle composite_tags.rs which exists as a standalone file

  I need to examine the issue with the logic. Let me first check if this is a critical Task A (string escapes) blocking issue by looking at the
  CompositeTagStrategy:

● Read(codegen/src/strategies/composite_tag.rs)
  ⎿  Read 20 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me search for the specific string escaping issue mentioned in the P07 document:

● Search(pattern: "conv\.replace\('\\\\', "\\\\\\\\"\)\.replace\('"', "\\\\\\""\)", path: "codegen/src/strategies", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 2 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! Found the critical bug mentioned in P07. This is the string escape issue at lines 305 and 314. Let me also check if there's a format_rust_string
  function available:

● Search(pattern: "format_rust_string", path: "codegen/src", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 4 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Excellent! The format_rust_string function exists in codegen/src/common/utils.rs and is already being used by other code. Now let me identify which tasks to
  prioritize:

  Based on the P07 document, Task A (string escapes) is the Priority 1 blocker that prevents compilation. The generated/mod.rs issue is Task B and can be fixed
  after A.

  Let me start with Task A first. Let me check the exact area that needs fixing:

● Read(codegen/src/strategies/composite_tag.rs)
  ⎿  Read 20 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! I found the exact lines (305 and 314) that need to be fixed. Let me check the format_rust_string import and signature:

● Read(codegen/src/common/utils.rs)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(codegen/src/common/utils.rs)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Search(pattern: "pub fn format_rust_string", path: "codegen/src/common/utils.rs", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 11 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! Now I understand the issue. The format_rust_string function exists and handles complex escaping including raw strings for regex patterns, but the
  composite_tag.rs file is using the old manual escaping method.

● Perfect! Now let me regenerate the codegen to test this fix:

● Excellent! The codegen worked and generated the proper string escaping. I can see in the composite_tags.rs file that the string escapes are now being handled
  properly with raw strings (e.g., the r#"..."# format in line 156 for the DOF print_conv).

  Now let me check the compilation status to see if Task A is complete:

● Great! I can see that the string escape bug (Task A) is completed. The compilation shows different error types now - mainly about missing modules but no string
  escape errors.

  Let me complete Task A and move on to Task B:

● Now for Task B: Fix missing module declarations. I can see from the current errors that:

  1. crate::generated::composite_tags - missing
  2. supported_tags - missing

  Looking at the codegen strategy earlier, I saw this code at lines 384-390 in update_main_mod_file where it checks for these modules, but the logic appears
  flawed. Let me check what's wrong with the codegen logic:

● Read(codegen/src/strategies/mod.rs)
  ⎿  Read 15 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I see two problems:

  1. The code tries to re-export from supported_tags (lines 396-400) even if that module doesn't exist
  2. It's missing handling for composite_tags.rs as a standalone file

  Let me check what files actually exist:

● Bash(find /home/mrm/src/exif-oxide/src/generated -maxdepth 1 -name "*.rs" | head -10)
  ⎿  /home/mrm/src/exif-oxide/src/generated/mod.rs           
     /home/mrm/src/exif-oxide/src/generated/composite_tags.rs

● Bash(ls -la /home/mrm/src/exif-oxide/src/generated/ | grep "supported_tags")
  ⎿  No matches found

● Perfect! So composite_tags.rs exists as a standalone file but supported_tags.rs does not exist, yet the codegen is trying to re-export from it. I need to fix the
   codegen logic:

● Update(codegen/src/strategies/mod.rs)

● Now let me regenerate the codegen to fix the module declarations:

● Bash(make codegen)
  ⎿  🔧 Running code generation...             
     🔧 Applying universal ExifTool patching...
     🚀 Running Rust codegen...
     … +367 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! The codegen worked. I can see that:

  1. composite_tags.rs module declaration was added at line 11
  2. The re-exports from composite_tags were added at lines 45-48
  3. file_types module declaration was added at line 17
  4. The format_rust_string fix is working - I can see raw strings like r#"..."# in the composite_tags.rs

  Let me now check if Task B is complete:

● Bash(cargo check 2>&1 | head -10)
  ⎿  error: unexpected argument '2' found

     Usage: cargo check [OPTIONS]
     … +2 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Bash(cargo check | head -10)
  ⎿      Checking exif-oxide v0.2.0-dev (/home/mrm/src/exif-oxide)            
     error[E0433]: failed to resolve: could not find `canon_pm` in `generated`
        --> src/implementations/canon/mod.rs:723:27
     … +847 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Excellent! I can see that the composite_tags module errors are now FIXED! There are no more errors like "could not find composite_tags in generated" or "no
  COMPOSITE_TAGS in generated".

  Task A (string escapes) and Task B (missing modules) are both COMPLETED.

  Now I can see the next major category of errors are Task D (legacy pm imports) - errors like:
  - could not find canon_pmingenerated`
  - could not find fujifilm_pmingenerated`
  - could not find nikon_pmingenerated`

  This matches exactly with the P07 document prediction. The old naming convention used *_pm but the new codegen uses snake_case like canon, fuji_film, nikon, etc.

  Let me complete Task B and move to the next task:

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Read all essential documentation before starting work                  
     ☒ Read CODEGEN.md - Universal extraction system architecture
     ☒ Read ARCHITECTURE.md - High-level system overview
     ☒ Read key guides (CORE-ARCHITECTURE, EXIFTOOL-GUIDE, etc.)
     ☒ Run cargo check to see current compilation error state
     ☒ Fix critical codegen string escape bug (Priority 1 blocker)
     ☒ Fix missing module declarations in generated/mod.rs
     ☐ Fix legacy *_pm import paths to new structure
     ☐ Complete MAIN_TAGS constant name fixes in all module mod.rs files
     ☐ Replace tag_kit:: function calls with module-specific functions
     ☐ Investigate missing olympus_lens_types and other specific function gaps

● Excellent progress! We've successfully completed the two highest priority tasks:

  ✅ Task A - COMPLETED: Fix critical codegen string escape bug (Priority 1 blocker)

  - Fixed the format_rust_string function usage in composite_tag.rs:305,314
  - Raw strings now properly handle complex Perl expressions
  - No more string escape compilation errors

  ✅ Task B - COMPLETED: Fix missing module declarations in generated/mod.rs

  - Added composite_tags module declaration
  - Added re-exports from composite_tags module
  - Fixed the codegen logic to properly handle standalone modules
  - No more "could not find composite_tags" errors

  The compilation has significantly improved. Now the main remaining error categories are:

  1. Task D: Legacy *_pm import paths (e.g. canon_pm → canon)
  2. Task C: MAIN_TAGS constant naming issues
  3. Task E: tag_kit:: function calls
  4. Task F: Missing specific functions like olympus_lens_types

  This matches exactly with the P07 document's predictions. We've eliminated the critical blockers and are now working through the import path updates.

  The next most impactful task would be Task D since these *_pm import errors are very numerous and affecting many files. Should I continue with fixing those
  legacy import paths?

> let's do task d

● Perfect! Let's tackle *Task D: Fix legacy _pm import paths to new structure.

  From the compilation errors, I can see the pattern clearly:
  - Old: canon_pm → New: canon
  - Old: fujifilm_pm → New: fuji_film
  - Old: nikon_pm → New: nikon
  - Old: olympus_pm → New: olympus
  - Old: sony_pm → New: sony
  - Old: xmp_pm → New: xmp
  - Old: minoltaraw_pm → New: minolta_raw
  - Old: panasonicraw_pm → New: panasonic_raw

  Let me systematically fix these import paths. I'll start by identifying all the affected files:
