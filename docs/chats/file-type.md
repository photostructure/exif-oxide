  The user wants me to read the P07c-file-types.md document and extensively research it, but they also note that it's critical work requiring exhaustive 
  prerequisite research. The prior engineer got good research done but there are "hand-wavy or nebulous aspects" that warrant additional research.

  I need to:
  1. Read P07c-file-types.md first
  2. Read the referenced sources and docs
  3. Validate and re-analyze the current situation, problem, and solution
  4. Show my work step by step
  5. Take time for research, planning, analysis, and validation

  I've already read:
  - third-party/exiftool/doc/concepts/FILE_TYPES.md
  - docs/done/20250705-CODEGEN-FILE-TYPE-LOOKUP.md
  - CLAUDE.md 
  - docs/TRUST-EXIFTOOL.md

  Now I need to read the P07c-file-types.md document to see what the current plan is.

● I need to read the current P07c-file-types.md document first to understand what the prior engineer planned. Let me start with that comprehensive analysis.

✻ Thinking…

  Now I've read the current P07c-file-types.md TPP. Let me analyze what I have so far:

  Summary of what I've read:

  1. Third-party/exiftool/doc/concepts/FILE_TYPES.md

  This is an extensive deep dive into ExifTool's file type detection system. Key points:
  - Multi-tiered detection: extension candidates → magic number validation → content analysis → vendor-specific logic → recovery mechanisms
  - Core data structures: %fileTypeLookup (extension mappings), %magicNumber (regex patterns), sophisticated edge case handling
  - Extensive manufacturer-specific workarounds and bug fixes
  - Complex magic number patterns, some exceeding 1KB test buffer
  - Graceful degradation and error recovery strategies

  2. docs/done/20250705-CODEGEN-FILE-TYPE-LOOKUP.md

  This is a completed milestone from July 2025 that implemented automated extraction of ExifTool's %fileTypeLookup hash. Key achievements:
  - Successfully extracted 344+ fileTypeLookup entries 
  - Implemented discriminated union pattern handling (aliases vs definitions)
  - Created helper functions for alias resolution
  - Generated type-safe Rust code with comprehensive testing
  - This milestone is marked as COMPLETED

  3. CLAUDE.md

  Project guidelines emphasizing:
  - Trust ExifTool principle - translate exactly, don't innovate
  - Use codegen when possible to avoid manual maintenance
  - Focus on mainstream tags initially
  - Follow conventional commit format
  - Various development practices and safety rules

  4. docs/TRUST-EXIFTOOL.md

  The fundamental principle of the project:
  - Translate ExifTool exactly, don't improve/optimize/simplify
  - Copy logic exactly even if it seems wrong
  - Preserve order of operations and special cases
  - Use automated codegen rather than manual porting
  - Limited deviations allowed only for GPS decimal format and internal inconsistencies

  I see the universal extractor is nearly complete, with a critical gap in file type detection strategies. The system needs comprehensive approaches to handle file
   type identification, particularly focusing on extension mapping, magic number validation, and MIME type recognition. This requires generating code that 
  precisely mirrors ExifTool's sophisticated multi-tiered detection mechanism, ensuring robust and accurate file type determination across diverse file formats.

  The proposed solution involves developing targeted strategies: a discriminated union pattern for file type lookup, converting Perl regex to Rust byte patterns 
  for magic number detection, and implementing a straightforward string-to-string mapping for MIME type identification. However, the plan reveals potential 
  inconsistencies with previously completed work, specifically the file type lookup extraction documented in July 2025.

  Key concerns emerge around the current system's architecture and the necessity of these proposed strategies. The plan requires careful verification of existing 
  implementations in the file type generation directories and detection modules. Critical questions persist about the integration of past work and the actual gaps 
  in the current extraction framework.

  The strategy system's scope needs thorough re-examination, particularly regarding whether the proposed strategies represent genuine requirements or redundant 
  efforts. Preliminary investigation suggests some components, like file type lookup, may already be resolved, potentially rendering parts of the proposed approach
   unnecessary.

  I'll need to dig deeper into the specific module expectations and clarify the precise integration challenges within the file detection system. The current 
  documentation lacks clarity on the exact nature of the missing elements and the relationship between existing and proposed generation approaches.

● Now let me examine what's actually been implemented and what the current state is. I need to understand the relationship between the completed July 2025 file
  type lookup work and the current universal extractor system.

● Read(src/file_detection.rs)
  ⎿  Read 1034 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now this is very informative! Looking at src/file_detection.rs, I can see that:

  1. The file detection system is already implemented and expects generated code from specific modules
  2. It's trying to import from generated modules that may not exist or be correctly generated:
    - Line 17: use crate::generated::exiftool_pm::lookup_mime_types;
    - Line 151: use crate::generated::file_types::resolve_file_type;
    - Line 197: use crate::generated::file_types::resolve_file_type;
    - Line 303: use crate::generated::exiftool_pm::regex_patterns::REGEX_PATTERNS;
    - Line 318: use crate::generated::file_types::resolve_file_type;
    - Line 564: use crate::generated::file_types::resolve_file_type;
    - Line 674: use crate::generated::file_types::resolve_file_type;
  3. The comments indicate the expected structure:
    - Line 28: References src/generated/exiftool_pm/weakmagic.rs  
    - Line 31: References src/generated/file_types/magic_numbers.rs
    - All magic number patterns should be generated from ExifTool's %magicNumber hash

  So now I need to check what's actually in the generated directories to understand the gap.

● Now let me check what's actually in the generated directories to understand what's missing:

● List(src/generated)
  ⎿  Listed 1057 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  I see there's a file_types/ directory. Let me check what's in there and what modules are expected vs present.

  Looking at the long listing, I can see:
  - There's a file_types/ directory with only mod.rs 
  - There are many manufacturer-specific modules (canon/, nikon/, olympus/, etc.) but these are for tag extraction, not file type detection
  - There are various module directories like ExifTool_pm/ that should contain the core ExifTool file type infrastructure

  Let me check the actual file_types directory content and the ExifTool_pm content to see what's missing.

● Let me check what's specifically in the file_types directory and the ExifTool_pm directory:

● List(src/generated/file_types)
  ⎿  Listed 6 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  So the file_types directory only has a mod.rs file. Let me check what's in the ExifTool_pm directory since that's where some of the imports are expecting to find
   things.

● List(src/generated/ExifTool_pm)
  ⎿  Listed 2 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  It looks like the ExifTool_pm directory doesn't exist yet, which explains why the imports are failing. Let me check the current mod.rs in file_types to see what 
  it contains:

● Read(src/generated/file_types/mod.rs)
  ⎿  Read 12 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  The mod.rs is expecting a file_type_lookup module but it's not present. Let me check if there's a file_type_lookup.rs file:

● Search(pattern: "src/generated/file_types/file_type_lookup*")
  ⎿  Found 0 files 

✻ Thinking…

  So the file_type_lookup.rs file doesn't exist, which explains the compilation issues. Let me check for any exiftool_pm modules:

● Search(pattern: "src/generated/**/exiftool_pm*")
  ⎿  Found 0 files 

✻ Thinking…

  Let me check if there are any old codegen generators in the codegen directory to understand what was supposed to generate these files:

● Read(codegen/src/generators)
  ⎿  Error: EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory, read

✻ Thinking…

  Let me list the contents of the generators directory:

● List(codegen/src/generators)
  ⎿  Listed 41 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Great! Now I can see there's a file_detection/ directory in generators. The TPP mentions that there are "old config generators in 
  codegen/src/generators/file_detection/ that contain working generators but they operate outside universal extraction pipeline".

  Let me examine these file detection generators to understand what was already implemented:

● Read(codegen/src/generators/file_detection/mod.rs)
  ⎿  Read 31 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  So there's already a file detection generation system! Let me check the types.rs file which should handle the file type lookup generation:

● Read(codegen/src/generators/file_detection/types.rs)
  ⎿  Read 243 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Excellent! Now I can see that there's already a complete file type lookup generation system. It expects a JSON file at 
  json_dir.join("file_types").join("exiftool_file_type_lookup.json"). This would generate the file_type_lookup.rs file that the mod.rs is expecting.

  Let me check the patterns.rs file too to see what it does for magic number patterns:

● Read(codegen/src/generators/file_detection/patterns.rs)
  ⎿  Read 436 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

> also -- as you're planning, know that we really do want to substantively reduce our manually-written code. @docs/TRUST-EXIFTOOL.md and @docs/CODEGEN.md discuss 
  why.

✻ Thinking…

  Excellent! Now I see there's also a sophisticated magic number pattern generation system. It expects exiftool__regex_patterns.json in the json_dir/file_types/ 
  directory.

  Let me also check what's in the mime.rs file to see if there's already a MIME type system:

● Read(codegen/src/generators/file_detection/mime.rs)
  ⎿  Read 12 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now let me check what the current universal extraction system looks like, particularly the strategies:

● Read(codegen/src/strategies/mod.rs)
  ⎿  Read 454 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the situation. Let me look at the codegen documentation next to understand what the goal is for reducing 
  manual code:

● Read(docs/CODEGEN.md)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines (ctrl+r to expand)
  ⎿  Interrupted by user

> And just for a little more context -- the prior codegen system had a arcane (and brittle) set of perl code extraction code and and specialized rust code 
  generators. The new "universal" approach uses just one perl script -- @codegen/scripts/field_extractor.pl -- and we just add a strategy to codegen/extractors
  codegen/src/strategies.
  ⎿  Read codegen/scripts/field_extractor.pl (206 lines)

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Research and validate field extractor output from ExifTool.pm %fileTypeLookup, %magicNumber, %mimeType
     ☐ Analyze existing strategy system and identify strategy integration points
     ☐ Examine file_detection.rs imports and identify missing generated modules
     ☐ Validate that strategy-based approach can handle file type patterns vs config-driven approach
     ☐ Design three new strategies: FileTypeLookupStrategy, MagicNumberStrategy, MimeTypeStrategy

     ☐ Integrate strategies into universal extraction pipeline
     ☐ Validate that file_detection.rs can successfully import and use generated modules
     ☐ Deprecate old config-driven file detection generators

● Now I understand the situation much better! Let me examine the failed imports in src/file_detection.rs to understand what's missing:

● Search(pattern: "use crate::generated::", path: "src/file_detection.rs", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 8 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Research and validate field extractor output from ExifTool.pm %fileTypeLookup, %magicNumber, %mimeType

● Based on my comprehensive research, I now have a clear understanding of the situation and what needs to be done. Let me present the plan:

> That looks great! It may be much easier to debug the field_extractor if we add an optional ARGV* to it that is a list of fields to extract -- then we can only 
  look at the fields we want. Let's do that before Step 1 -- or if you prefer, we can just use `jq` filtering, but that's a bit less ergonomic for future engineers
   I think. Let's do it!

● Perfect! That's a much better approach for debugging and development. Let me implement the optional field filtering in field_extractor.pl first, then we can use
  it to cleanly examine just the file type detection patterns we need.

● Bash(perl codegen/scripts/field_extractor.pl third-party/exiftool/lib/Image/ExifTool.pm fileTypeLookup magicNumber mimeType 2>/dev/null)
  ⎿  {                               
       "data": {
         "360": [
     … +1663 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Excellent! The field extractor with filtering works perfectly. Now I can see the three key patterns we need to handle:

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Research and validate field extractor output from ExifTool.pm %fileTypeLookup, %magicNumber, %mimeType
     ☐ Analyze existing strategy system and identify strategy integration points
     ☐ Examine file_detection.rs imports and identify missing generated modules
     ☐ Validate that strategy-based approach can handle file type patterns vs config-driven approach
     ☐ Design three new strategies: FileTypeLookupStrategy, MagicNumberStrategy, MimeTypeStrategy
     ☐ Implement the three file type detection strategies with proper pattern recognition
     ☐ Integrate strategies into universal extraction pipeline
     ☐ Validate that file_detection.rs can successfully import and use generated modules
     ☐ Deprecate old config-driven file detection generators

● Perfect! I now have clear visibility into the extracted patterns:

  1. fileTypeLookup: 344 entries with discriminated union pattern (string aliases like "3GP2":"3G2" vs array definitions like "360":["MOV","GoPro 360 video"])
  2. magicNumber: 111 regex patterns for binary detection (like "JPEG":"\\xff\\xd8\\xff")
  3. mimeType: 226 simple string→string mappings (like "JPEG":"image/jpeg")

  Now let me examine the existing strategy system:

● Read(codegen/src/strategies/simple_table.rs)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Now let me look at the can_handle method to understand the pattern recognition:

● Search(pattern: "fn can_handle", path: "codegen/src/strategies/simple_table.rs", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 15 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Search(pattern: "fn can_handle", path: "codegen/src/strategies/simple_table.rs", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 26 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! Now I understand the pattern recognition system. Let me check what patterns are needed for file types by examining the actual data structures from my
  extraction:

  1. fileTypeLookup: Mixed types - some values are strings ("3GP2":"3G2"), others are arrays ("360":["MOV","description"])
  2. magicNumber: All string values with regex patterns
  3. mimeType: All simple string→string mappings

  Let me create the three new strategies. First, I'll create the FileTypeLookupStrategy:

     //! FileTypeLookupStrategy for processing ExifTool's discriminated union file type patterns
     //!
     //! This strategy handles the %fileTypeLookup symbol which uses a discriminated union pattern:
     //! - String values are aliases: "3GP2" → "3G2"

     //! - Array values can have multiple formats: "AI" → [["PDF","PS"], "Adobe Illustrator"]

     use std::collections::HashMap;
     use tracing::{debug, info};

  ⎿  Wrote 201 lines to codegen/src/strategies/mime_type.rs

     //!
     //! This strategy handles the %mimeType symbol which contains simple string->string
     //! mappings from file types to MIME types (e.g., "JPEG":"image/jpeg")
