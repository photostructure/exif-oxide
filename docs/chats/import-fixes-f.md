  The user is asking me to work on Task E from docs/todo/P07-codegen-import-fixes.md. I need to read this file to understand what Task E is about. They also 
  mention that I should read all referenced sources and documentation before starting, and that I need to understand the "mystery" of canonmodelid vs 
  canon_model_id in imports - specifically that codegen and src/*.rs should use the "canon_model_id" form.

  Let me start by reading the P07-codegen-import-fixes.md document first.

● I'll help you work on Task E from the P07-codegen-import-fixes.md technical project plan. Let me start by reading the TPP document and all referenced sources to
  understand the task thoroughly.

  Now I can see the context of Task E from the P07-codegen-import-fixes.md document. Let me break down what Task E involves:

  Task E: Replace tag_kit:: function calls with module-specific functions

  Success Criteria:
  - Implementation: All tag_kit references replaced → grep -r "tag_kit::" src/ returns empty (currently ~20 files)
  - Research complete: Function mapping documented → Each tag_kit::apply_print_conv call mapped to appropriate module function
  - Specific mappings resolved:
    - tag_kit::apply_print_conv → Module-specific PrintConv functions or registry calls  
    - tag_kit::has_subdirectory → TBD (research needed)
    - tag_kit::process_subdirectory → TBD (research needed)  
    - tag_kit::EXIF_PM_TAG_KITS → generated::exif::EXIF_MAIN_TAGS
  - Integration: Functions correctly wired → Core tag processing works with new structure
  - Manual validation: cargo run -- test-images/canon/Canon_T3i.jpg produces identical output

  The user also mentioned the "mystery" of canonmodelid vs canon_model_id in imports - they want codegen and src/*.rs to use the "canon_model_id" form.

  Looking at the document, there are some key points:
  1. Universal extraction has changed from monolithic tag_kit:: patterns to specific module paths like generated::canon::canon_quality::lookup_canon_quality
  2. The new structure creates focused modules instead of mega-files
  3. Each old tag_kit::apply_print_conv call needs to be replaced with module-specific function from new structure
  4. There are naming issues with canonModelID → canon_model_id conversion
  5. String escaping was broken but has been fixed

  6. Legacy *_pm imports have been fixed

  I'll dive into preparation for Task E by investigating the current project state. I need to systematically explore the codebase's tag_kit references, understand 
  the existing patterns, and map out a strategy for replacing these function calls with more modular, specific implementations. This involves a comprehensive 
  review of compilation errors, documentation, and current usage patterns to ensure a smooth transition.

● Now I understand Task E. I need to replace all tag_kit:: function calls with module-specific functions from the new universal extraction structure. Let me begin
  by reading the essential documentation and understanding the current state.

  I'm in plan mode so I need to do research first and then present my plan using ExitPlanMode. Let me continue with the research phase by reading the essential 
  documentation and surveying the current state.

  Let me start by reading CODEGEN.md to understand the universal extraction system architecture.

     ☐ Validate compilation and functionality works

✻ Thinking…

  I need to read the CODEGEN.md documentation first to understand the universal extraction system architecture, then survey the current tag_kit:: usage patterns, 
  and research the mappings needed.

  I can see this is a long document. Let me continue reading to understand the universal extraction system better. I need to understand what replaced the tag_kit 
  system.

● Read(docs/CODEGEN.md)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I'm getting a better picture. I can see that the new system has moved from monolithic tag_kit:: patterns to specific module paths like canon::canonmodelid:: 
  etc. Let me continue reading to understand the universal extraction system better and then look at the current tag_kit:: usage patterns.

● Search(pattern: "tag_kit::", path: "src")
  ⎿  Found 14 files (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Good! I found 14 files that still have tag_kit:: references. Now let me look at some examples to understand what functions are being called and what they need to
   be replaced with.

● Search(pattern: "tag_kit::", path: "src", output_mode: "content", head_limit: 20)
  ⎿  Found 20 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I can see the specific tag_kit:: functions that need to be replaced:

  1. tag_kit::apply_print_conv - This appears to be the most common one
  2. tag_kit::has_subdirectory 
  3. tag_kit::process_subdirectory

  Let me look at what modules are being imported to see what the new structure looks like:

● Read(src/registry.rs)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  I can see that there's a Registry system that provides runtime lookup of conversion functions. Let me check what tag_kit:: functions look like and what they're 
  supposed to be replaced with. Let me look at some specific examples:

● Read(src/implementations/canon/mod.rs)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Let me look at where these tag_kit:: functions are actually used and how they should be replaced. Let me look at a specific file that uses 
  tag_kit::apply_print_conv:

● Read(src/implementations/canon/mod.rs)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Let me look at the specific functions that call tag_kit:: to understand what they do:

● Search(pattern: "tag_kit::", path: "src/implementations/canon/mod.rs", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 23 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  I can see there are references to tag_kit functions like:
  - tag_kit::has_subdirectory
  - tag_kit::process_subdirectory
  - tag_kit::apply_print_conv

  Let me check the current generated structure to see what modules exist that could replace these:

● List(src/generated)
  ⎿  Listed 966 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Great! Now I can see the new structure. I can see that the old tag_kit:: functions have been replaced with a new modular structure. Let me look at the current 
  generated/mod.rs to see what's being exported:

● Read(src/generated/mod.rs)
  ⎿  Read 48 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  I notice there's no re-export of composite_tags at the module level. But from the P07 document, it mentions that Task B was completed and composite_tags module 
  should be accessible. Let me check if composite_tags.rs exists:

● Read(src/generated/composite_tags.rs)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Great! I can see that composite_tags.rs exists and has composite tag definitions. Now let me check the current compilation state to understand what errors exist:

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Read essential documentation (CODEGEN.md, current compilation state) 
     ☐ Survey current tag_kit:: usage patterns in codebase
     ☐ Research function mapping from tag_kit:: to module-specific functions
     ☐ Replace tag_kit:: function calls systematically
     ☐ Validate compilation and functionality works

✻ Thinking…

  Now let me check some other key tag_kit usages to understand better what needs to be replaced. Let me look at a specific file that's using 
  tag_kit::apply_print_conv:

● Read(src/implementations/canon/binary_data.rs)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Let me look for the actual tag_kit::apply_print_conv calls in this file:

● Search(pattern: "tag_kit::apply_print_conv", path: "src/implementations/canon/binary_data.rs", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 120 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I can see the pattern! The tag_kit::apply_print_conv function is being called with:
  - A tag ID
  - A TagValue reference  
  - An ExpressionEvaluator
  - Error and warning vectors

  And I can see at the bottom there that there's already an import use crate::generated::canon::main_tags::CANON_MAIN_TAGS; which suggests the new system is 
  already partially in place.

  Let me check what's in the registry.rs file to see how PrintConv function lookup should work now:

● Read(src/registry.rs)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! So I can see that the registry system provides apply_print_conv method that takes a function name and TagValue. But the old tag_kit::apply_print_conv 
  was taking a tag ID instead. Let me check where this was defined to understand better. Let me also check the current compilation state to see the actual errors:

● Bash(cargo check 2>&1 | head -30)
  ⎿  error: unexpected argument '2' found

     Usage: cargo check [OPTIONS]
     … +2 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  I need to be more careful with bash syntax. Let me use a different approach to check compilation:

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Read essential documentation (CODEGEN.md, current compilation state) 
     ☒ Survey current tag_kit:: usage patterns in codebase
     ☐ Research function mapping from tag_kit:: to module-specific functions
     ☐ Replace tag_kit:: function calls systematically
     ☐ Validate compilation and functionality works

✻ Thinking…

  Let me check where the old tag_kit::apply_print_conv function was supposed to come from. The fact that there are import errors suggests it doesn't exist anymore.
   Let me check if there's a replacement function or approach in the new system:

● Search(pattern: "apply_print_conv", path: "src")
  ⎿  Found 16 files (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Let me check if there's a similar function in the subdirectory_processing.rs or composite_tags/orchestration.rs that might be the replacement:

● Read(src/exif/subdirectory_processing.rs)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! I can see the pattern now. There's a generic process_subdirectories_with_printconv function that takes manufacturer-specific functions as parameters, 
  including an apply_print_conv_fn. This suggests that each manufacturer module should have its own specific apply_print_conv function.

  Let me check what's in one of the manufacturer modules (canon) to see if there are specific functions:

● Read(src/generated/canon/mod.rs)
  ⎿  Read 128 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Great! I can see that there are specific modules like canon_quality, canon_white_balance, and main_tags. I can also see the comment about the mismatch between 
  MAIN_TAGS → CANON_MAIN_TAGS that was mentioned in the P07 document. That's likely Task C.

  Now let me check if there are functions like apply_print_conv in one of these specific modules. Let me look at the canon_quality module:

● Read(src/generated/canon/canon_quality.rs)
  ⎿  Read 29 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! Now I understand the pattern. The new system has:

  1. Specific lookup functions like lookup_canon_quality(key: u8) that replace the old generic tag_kit::apply_print_conv(tag_id, value, ...) approach
  2. Module-specific functions instead of generic tag_kit functions
  3. Simple lookup tables generated from ExifTool data

  But I still need to understand what should replace the tag_kit::apply_print_conv function that takes a tag_id and looks up the appropriate conversion. Let me 
  check if there's a function that can dispatch based on tag ID to the appropriate lookup function.

  Let me check what functions are available in the composite_tags system:

● Read(src/composite_tags/orchestration.rs)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  I can see there's use crate::registry; at the bottom, which suggests there might be registry-based conversions. I can also see there are several TODO comments 
  mentioning P07 build issues - this confirms that this is indeed part of the Task E work.

  Now I have a clearer understanding of the situation. Let me complete my research by understanding the pattern for each type of tag_kit:: function:

  1. tag_kit::apply_print_conv - should be replaced by:
    - Direct lookup functions like lookup_canon_quality(value) for simple lookups
    - Registry-based conversions using crate::registry::apply_print_conv(func_name, value) for complex conversions
    - Or module-specific apply_print_conv functions
  2. tag_kit::has_subdirectory and tag_kit::process_subdirectory - should be replaced by module-specific functions

  Let me check what patterns exist for the subdirectory functions:

● Search(pattern: "has_subdirectory", path: "src", output_mode: "content", head_limit: 5)
  ⎿  Found 5 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I have enough information to understand Task E and present my plan. Let me summarize what I've learned:

  Current State Analysis:

  1. tag_kit:: functions no longer exist - The old monolithic tag_kit:: system has been replaced by a new modular universal extraction system.
  2. New module structure - Generated modules like canon::canon_quality::lookup_canon_quality(), canon::main_tags::CANON_MAIN_TAGS, etc.
  3. Three types of functions to replace:
    - tag_kit::apply_print_conv(tag_id, value, evaluator, errors, warnings) - Used ~15+ times across the codebase
    - tag_kit::has_subdirectory(tag_id) - Used in subdirectory processing
    - tag_kit::process_subdirectory(...) - Used in subdirectory processing
    - tag_kit::EXIF_PM_TAG_KITS - Constants that need to be replaced with generated::exif::EXIF_MAIN_TAGS
  4. Replacement patterns:
    - Simple lookups: Replace with direct calls like canon::canon_quality::lookup_canon_quality(value as u8)
    - Complex conversions: Use the registry system crate::registry::apply_print_conv(func_name, value)
    - Subdirectory functions: Replace with manufacturer-specific implementations
    - Constants: Replace with module-specific constants like CANON_MAIN_TAGS
  5. Key insight: The user mentioned the canonmodelid vs canon_model_id naming issue - codegen should use snake_case like canon_model_id but there may be 
  mismatches.

  Files affected (14 files with tag_kit:: references):

  - /home/mrm/src/exif-oxide/src/raw/utils.rs

  - /home/mrm/src/exif-oxide/src/formats/iptc.rs
  - /home/mrm/src/exif-oxide/src/implementations/panasonic_raw.rs
  - /home/mrm/src/exif-oxide/src/implementations/minolta_raw.rs

  - /home/mrm/src/exif-oxide/src/implementations/olympus/mod.rs
  - /home/mrm/src/exif-oxide/src/implementations/nikon/mod.rs

  I'll need to systematically update these files to remove tag_kit:: references and migrate to the new modular extraction system. Each file will require careful 
  replacement of function calls and constants, ensuring compatibility with the new architecture while maintaining existing functionality.

  The migration involves:
  - Identifying all tag_kit:: function calls
  - Mapping to appropriate new module functions
  - Updating constant references
  - Verifying type conversions and processing logic

  This approach ensures a comprehensive and consistent transition across multiple implementation files.

  ⎿ Task E: Replace tag_kit:: function calls with module-specific functions

    Research Summary

    I've completed comprehensive research and identified the scope and approach for Task E. The old monolithic tag_kit:: system has been replaced by a new 
    universal extraction structure with specific module paths.

    Current Situation:

    - 14 files contain tag_kit:: references that need replacement
    - 3 main function types to replace:
      a. tag_kit::apply_print_conv(tag_id, value, evaluator, errors, warnings) - ~15+ usages
      b. tag_kit::has_subdirectory(tag_id) - Used in subdirectory processing  
      c. tag_kit::process_subdirectory(...) - Used in subdirectory processing

    New System Architecture:

    - Generated modules: canon::canon_quality::lookup_canon_quality(), canon::main_tags::CANON_MAIN_TAGS
    - Registry system: crate::registry::apply_print_conv(func_name, value) for complex conversions
    - Module-specific functions: Each manufacturer has their own implementations

    Implementation Plan

    Phase 1: Analyze Replacement Patterns (30 mins)

    1. Map each tag_kit::apply_print_conv call to determine replacement strategy:
      - Simple lookups → Direct module functions (canon::canon_quality::lookup_canon_quality)
      - Complex conversions → Registry calls (registry::apply_print_conv) 
      - Tag ID based → Need to implement dispatch logic
    2. Identify subdirectory function patterns:
      - Check which manufacturers need has_subdirectory/process_subdirectory implementations
      - Verify if manufacturer-specific versions exist in generated code

    Phase 2: Systematic Replacement (2-3 hours)

    1. Replace apply_print_conv calls by file:
      - Canon files: Use canon:: specific lookups where available
      - Sony files: Use sony:: specific lookups 
      - Generic cases: Use registry system
    2. Replace subdirectory functions:
      - Map to manufacturer-specific implementations
      - Update function signatures as needed
    3. Replace constants: 
      - tag_kit::EXIF_PM_TAG_KITS → generated::exif::EXIF_MAIN_TAGS

    Phase 3: Address Naming Issues (30 mins)

    1. Fix canonmodelid vs canon_model_id discrepancies
    2. Ensure consistent snake_case usage throughout

    Phase 4: Validation (30 mins)

    1. Run cargo check to verify compilation
    2. Test with sample image to ensure functionality preserved
    3. Verify no regressions in tag extraction

    Success Criteria

    - ✅ grep -r "tag_kit::" src/ returns empty result
    - ✅ cargo check succeeds with 0 compilation errors
    - ✅ cargo run -- test-images/canon/Canon_T3i.jpg produces identical output
    - ✅ All existing functionality preserved

    Files to Modify (14 files)

    Focus areas: Canon binary data processing, Sony processors, manufacturer implementations, and core EXIF processing.

  patterns.

  ⎿  Found 179 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Excellent! Now I can see the patterns clearly. I can see there are several different usage patterns:

  1. Simple tag ID based calls: Most calls follow the pattern tag_kit::apply_print_conv(tag_id, &value, &mut evaluator, &mut errors, &mut warnings)
  2. Subdirectory processing calls: Files like canon/mod.rs, sony/mod.rs, nikon/mod.rs, olympus/mod.rs are passing tag_kit::apply_print_conv as a function pointer 
  to process_subdirectories_with_printconv
  3. Mixed calls: In exif/tags.rs there are calls like gps_tag_kit::apply_print_conv and sony_tag_kit::apply_print_conv which suggest these may already be 
  partially migrated
  4. Commented out calls: raw/utils.rs has a commented out call

  Looking at the patterns, I need to:

  1. For simple tag ID calls: These need to be replaced with either:
    - Direct lookup functions (for simple cases)
    - Registry-based conversion
    - Module-specific apply_print_conv functions
  2. For subdirectory processing: These need manufacturer-specific implementations

  Let me look at what functions are available in the generated modules to determine the replacement approach:

● Perfect! I can see the usage patterns clearly. Let me check what functions are available in the generated modules to determine the best replacement approach.

● Search(pattern: "pub fn.*print_conv", path: "src/generated", output_mode: "content", head_limit: 10)
  ⎿  Found 2 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  It looks like there are only a couple of print_conv functions in the generated modules. Let me check for other patterns like "apply" functions or see if there's 
  a central apply_print_conv function that takes tag ID:

● Search(pattern: "pub fn.*apply", path: "src/generated")
  ⎿  Found 0 files 

✻ Thinking…

  Let me check if there are main_tags modules that might contain tag definitions or apply functions:

● Read(src/generated/canon/main_tags.rs)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Interesting! I can see that the TagInfo structure has a print_conv: None field. This suggests that the new system is designed to work differently. Let me check 
  what the PrintConv type looks like and how the registry system is supposed to work:

● Search(pattern: "PrintConv", path: "src/types", output_mode: "content", head_limit: 10)
  ⎿  Found 10 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Let me check the PrintConv enum definition to understand how the new system should work:

● Read(src/types/tag_info.rs)
  ⎿  Read 86 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! Now I understand the architecture better. The PrintConv enum has different types including Simple, Expression, and Complex. The TagInfo structure should
   contain the print conversion logic.

  But I notice that the Canon main tags I saw earlier all had print_conv: None. This suggests that either:
  1. The codegen isn't populating the PrintConv information yet (part of the P07 issues)
  2. The PrintConv logic is handled separately through the registry system

  Let me check if there are specific apply_print_conv functions that should be generated for each manufacturer. But first, let me identify what's currently 
  breaking in order to understand the immediate replacement strategy.

  Based on my analysis, I think the approach should be:

  1. For simple cases: Use the registry system crate::registry::apply_print_conv(function_name, value)
  2. For subdirectory processing: Create manufacturer-specific wrapper functions
  3. For tag ID dispatch: Create functions that can map tag IDs to the appropriate conversions

  Let me start implementing the replacements systematically:

● Now I understand the architecture better. The new system uses a registry approach with PrintConv types. Let me check what already exists for replacement
  functions and then start implementing the fixes.

  Now let me check one of these files to see how the subdirectory functions are being used:

● Read(src/implementations/canon/mod.rs)
  ⎿  Read 40 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Let me find the specific usage of the tag_kit::has_subdirectory functions:

● Search(pattern: "tag_kit::has_subdirectory", path: "src/implementations/canon/mod.rs", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 10 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! Now I can see the usage pattern. The process_subdirectories_with_printconv function is being called with tag_kit::has_subdirectory, 
  tag_kit::process_subdirectory, and tag_kit::apply_print_conv as function pointers. This means I need to create manufacturer-specific implementations of these 
  functions.

  Based on the analysis, here's my replacement strategy:

  1. For tag_kit::apply_print_conv in binary processing: These should be replaced with registry-based calls or specific lookup functions
  2. For subdirectory processing: I need to create manufacturer-specific functions that replace the tag_kit functions
  3. For the few standalone calls: Use registry system

  Let me start implementing the replacements systematically. I'll start with the most common case - the binary data processing in Canon files:

● Perfect! Now I can see the usage pattern clearly. Let me complete the subdirectory pattern identification and then start implementing the replacements.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Phase 1: Analyze replacement patterns for tag_kit::apply_print_conv calls
     ☒ Phase 1: Identify subdirectory function patterns
     ☐ Phase 2: Replace apply_print_conv calls systematically
     ☐ Phase 2: Replace subdirectory functions
     ☐ Phase 2: Replace constants (tag_kit::EXIF_PM_TAG_KITS)
     ☐ Phase 3: Fix canonmodelid vs canon_model_id naming issues
     ☐ Phase 4: Validate compilation and functionality

✻ Thinking…

  Based on my analysis, I need to implement replacements for:

  Pattern 1: Simple tag_kit::apply_print_conv calls

  These need to be replaced with:
  - Registry-based calls: crate::registry::get_global_registry().write().unwrap().apply_print_conv(func_name, value)
  - Direct lookup functions for simple cases

  Pattern 2: Subdirectory processing function pointers

  Files like canon/mod.rs, sony/mod.rs, etc. pass tag_kit functions as parameters to process_subdirectories_with_printconv. I need to create manufacturer-specific 
  implementations.

  Let me start with the Canon binary data processing since that has the most calls. I'll need to replace the tag_kit::apply_print_conv calls with registry-based 
  ones. Let me start with the Canon file:

● Now I'll start Phase 2 by replacing the apply_print_conv calls systematically. Let me begin with the Canon binary data processing since it has the most calls:

● Read(src/implementations/canon/binary_data.rs)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Let me find the exact location of the tag_kit::apply_print_conv calls I need to replace:

● Search(pattern: "tag_kit::apply_print_conv", path: "src/implementations/canon/binary_data.rs", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 8 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! I can see there are 8 calls to tag_kit::apply_print_conv in the Canon binary_data.rs file. Let me look at one of these calls to understand the pattern 
  and implement the replacement. 

  The calls are using tag IDs and need to be replaced with registry-based calls. I need to understand how to use the registry system properly. Let me check how the
   registry should be accessed:

● Let me examine a specific tag_kit::apply_print_conv call to understand the replacement pattern:

● Read(src/implementations/canon/binary_data.rs)
  ⎿  Read 15 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! I can see that the generated files have been updated and now I have much better information. Looking at the CANON_MAIN_TAGS structure, I can see that it
   now has proper PrintConv fields, some of which are:

  1. PrintConv::Expression(...) - Contains Perl expressions that need to be handled by the registry
  2. PrintConv::Complex - Indicates complex conversions 
  3. None - No conversion needed

  This gives me a clear path forward. For the tag_kit::apply_print_conv calls, I should:

  1. Look up the tag in the CANON_MAIN_TAGS table
  2. Based on the PrintConv type, either:
    - Use registry for Expression/Complex types
    - Use direct lookup functions for simple cases  
    - Return the original value for None

  Let me implement a Canon-specific apply_print_conv function that can handle this dispatch logic. First, let me create a helper function to replace the 
  tag_kit::apply_print_conv calls:

● Excellent! Now I can see the pattern clearly. The generated CANON_MAIN_TAGS table has PrintConv fields that tell me how to handle conversions. Let me implement a
   replacement function. I'll start by creating a Canon-specific apply_print_conv function that can dispatch based on the PrintConv type.

  Now I need to update all the tag_kit::apply_print_conv calls in the panasonic_raw.rs file to use my new function:

● Now let me update all the tag_kit::apply_print_conv calls to use my new function:

✻ Thinking…

  Great! I've completed the Canon and Panasonic RAW files. Let me continue with the remaining files. Let me now move on to the minolta_raw.rs file. I should 
  continue working through the list systematically. Let me update my progress and then move on to the next file:

● Perfect! I've completed the Canon binary_data.rs and panasonic_raw.rs files. Now let me continue with the minolta_raw.rs file. Let me check what modules exist
  for Minolta Raw:

● Read(src/implementations/minolta_raw.rs)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  I can see that minolta_raw.rs is using the old import structure. Let me check what the new minolta_raw module structure looks like:

● List(src/generated/minolta_raw)
  ⎿  Listed 10 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! I can see there's a main_tags.rs file. Let me check the main_tags.rs to see what tag IDs are available:

● Read(src/generated/minolta_raw/main_tags.rs)
  ⎿  Read 14 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  I can see that the MinoltaRaw main_tags.rs only has an empty tags HashMap. This suggests that the MinoltaRaw tags might be in other modules like prd_tags.rs. Let
   me check what's in the prd_tags.rs file since the current code is calling tag ID 18 which should be in the PRD table:

● I see that the MinoltaRaw main_tags.rs is empty. Let me check the prd_tags.rs file since the current code references PRD tags:

● Read(src/generated/minolta_raw/prd_tags.rs)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Let me continue reading to find tag IDs 18, 23, 5, 58, and 74 that are used in the minolta_raw.rs file:

● Search(pattern: "(18|23|5|58|74),", path: "src/generated/minolta_raw/prd_tags.rs", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 16 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Great! I can see that tag IDs 18 and 23 exist in prd_tags.rs and both have PrintConv::Complex. Let me check if tag IDs 5, 58, and 74 are there too:

● Search(pattern: "(5|58|74),", path: "src/generated/minolta_raw", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 26 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! I can see that:
  - Tag IDs 18 and 23 are in prd_tags.rs (both PrintConv::Complex)
  - Tag IDs 5, 58, and 74 are in rif_tags.rs (all PrintConv::Complex)

  This means I need to create a more complex dispatch function for MinoltaRaw that can handle different tag tables. Let me update the minolta_raw.rs file to use 
  the new structure. I'll need to import both tag tables and create a dispatcher:

● Perfect! I can see that:
  - Tag IDs 18 and 23 are in PRD tags (both PrintConv::Complex)
  - Tag IDs 5, 58, and 74 are in RIF tags (all PrintConv::Complex)

  I need to create a dispatcher that can handle multiple tag tables. Let me update the minolta_raw.rs file:

● Update(src/implementations/minolta_raw.rs)
