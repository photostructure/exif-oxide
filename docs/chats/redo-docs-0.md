we've got some outdated documentation in docs/*.md, docs/guides/*.md, and docs/reference/*.md with respect to our codegen system. We 
  just changed it substantially -- it had been N completely discrete extraction pipelines that each had their own perl and config and rust
   components. We now have a dramatically simpler "unified field" system that uses @codegen/scripts/field_extractor.pl and then a set of N
   "strategies" (in codegen/src/strategies/*.rs) to (at least try to) process _all_ of the fields in ExifTool, comprehensively (if they're
   in the @config/exiftool_modules.json and a strategy knows how to handle them). Please take your time and first gather a list of all 
  documentation that matches docs/*.md, docs/guides/*.md, and docs/reference/*.md, and then, for each file, 1. replace any outdated 
  documentation with the new architecture, 2. consider aggregating the document (do we need both CODEGEN.md and EXTRACTOR-GUIDES.md, for 
  example?) Ultrathink and take your time.

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking me to update outdated documentation in the docs/.md, docs/guides/.md, and docs/reference/*.md with respect to the new
   unified codegen system. They mention that we've changed from N completely discrete extraction pipelines to a dramatically simpler 
  "unified field" system using:

  1. codegen/scripts/field_extractor.pl (which I just read)
  2. A set of N "strategies" in codegen/src/strategies/*.rs 
  3. The system processes all fields in ExifTool comprehensively if they're in config/exiftool_modules.json (which I just read)

  They want me to:
  1. First gather a list of all documentation that matches docs/.md, docs/guides/.md, and docs/reference/*.md
  2. For each file: replace any outdated documentation with the new architecture, and consider aggregating documents (like whether we need
   both CODEGEN.md and EXTRACTOR-GUIDES.md)

  Since I'm in plan mode, I need to first research and understand the current documentation, then present a plan.

  Let me start by getting a list of all the documentation files in those directories.

● I'll help you update the documentation to reflect the new unified codegen system. Let me start by gathering a comprehensive list of all
  the documentation files and then analyze each one to understand what needs updating.

  the code structure and architecture first.

> legacy config doesn't even really need to be documented. This is really critical documentation -- please take your time to do more 
  research and dig into the code more. Ultrathink.

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking me to really dig deep and think critically about the documentation updates. They're emphasizing that this is critical
   documentation and I should take my time to understand the system thoroughly before proposing changes. They also note that legacy config
   doesn't really need to be documented anymore - it sounds like they want to focus on the current unified system.

  Let me really dig into the code and understand the new system better. I should:

  1. Look more deeply at the strategies themselves to understand how they work
  2. Examine the field extractor more thoroughly  
  3. Look at what the actual generated code looks like
  4. Understand the full workflow from symbol extraction to code generation
  5. Look at examples of how the strategies recognize patterns
  6. Understand the module organization and naming conventions
  7. See what the strategy selection log looks like
  8. Look at the output locations strategy
  9. Examine the conversion registry system
  10. Look at real examples of generated files

  Let me start by examining some of the key strategy implementations to understand the pattern recognition logic.

  documentation changes.
