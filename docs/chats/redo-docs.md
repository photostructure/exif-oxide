● ExifTool Unified Codegen System: Documentation Update Analysis

  Executive Summary

  After extensive research into the codebase, I've discovered that exif-oxide has undergone a fundamental architectural transformation
  from a legacy config-driven extraction system to a sophisticated unified strategy pattern architecture. This represents one of the most
  significant engineering achievements in the project - a complete reimagining of how ExifTool integration works.

  The Architectural Revolution

  What Changed: From Configuration Hell to Intelligence

  OLD SYSTEM (Legacy):
  - 67+ manual JSON configuration files
  - 11+ discrete Perl extractors (tag_kit.pl, simple_table.pl, etc.)
  - Manual pattern recognition and extractor selection
  - Partial symbol discovery limited to configured extractions
  - Maintenance nightmare with monthly ExifTool updates

  NEW SYSTEM (Current):
  - ZERO configuration files required
  - Single universal extractor (field_extractor.pl) discovers ALL symbols automatically
  - Intelligent duck-typing pattern recognition via 9 competing strategies
  - Complete symbol discovery across all ExifTool modules
  - Self-adapting to ExifTool evolution

  The Core Innovation: Duck-Typed Strategy Pattern

  The system now operates through competitive pattern recognition:

  1. Universal Discovery: field_extractor.pl extracts ALL hash symbols from any ExifTool module via Perl symbol table introspection
  2. Strategy Competition: 9 Rust strategies compete to claim symbols using can_handle() pattern recognition
  3. Intelligent Routing: First-match-wins with carefully prioritized strategy order
  4. Code Generation: Winning strategies generate appropriate Rust code

  Example of the intelligence:
  // SimpleTableStrategy automatically recognizes lookup tables
  fn can_handle(&self, symbol: &FieldSymbol) -> bool {
      if let JsonValue::Object(map) = &symbol.data {
          let all_strings = map.values().all(|v| v.is_string());
          let not_tag_def = !map.contains_key("PrintConv");
          let known_table = ["canonWhiteBalance"].contains(&symbol.name.as_str());
          (all_strings && not_tag_def) || known_table
      } else { false }
  }

  Strategy System Architecture

  The 9 Strategies (Priority Order)

  | Priority | Strategy               | Recognizes                         | Generates                               |
  |----------|------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
  | 1        | CompositeTagStrategy   | Composite tables with dependencies | Runtime metadata for dynamic evaluation |
  | 2        | FileTypeLookupStrategy | Objects with Description+Format    | File type discrimination code           |
  | 3        | MagicNumberStrategy    | Binary escape sequences            | Magic number pattern matching           |
  | 4        | MimeTypeStrategy       | String-to-string MIME mappings     | MIME type lookup tables                 |
  | 5        | SimpleTableStrategy    | String-only hash values            | Static HashMap lookups                  |
  | 6        | TagKitStrategy         | Tag definitions with PrintConv     | Complete tag processing bundles         |
  | 7        | BinaryDataStrategy     | Binary data attributes             | ProcessBinaryData structures            |
  | 8        | BooleanSetStrategy     | Membership sets (all values = 1)   | HashSet existence checks                |
  | 9        | ScalarArrayStrategy    | Arrays of primitives               | Static array constants                  |

  Hybrid Architecture: Compile-time + Runtime

  The system implements a sophisticated hybrid evaluation architecture:

  Compile-time Optimization (TagKitStrategy):
  - Regular tags with static dependencies
  - Expression compiler for simple arithmetic ($val / 8 → inline Rust)
  - Static lookup table generation
  - Performance-critical path

  Runtime Evaluation (CompositeTagStrategy):
  - Composite tags with dynamic dependencies ($val[n] patterns)
  - Dependency resolution based on available tags in each file
  - Registry-based Perl expression evaluation
  - Flexibility-critical path

  Technical Sophistication

  The Make-Everything-Public patcher

  codegen/scripts/patch_exiftool_modules_universal.pl temporarily edits the actual ExifTool perl source code, replacing all `my %` to `our %` to allow the field_extractor.pl to see all fields in all modules.

  Field Extractor: The Universal Discovery Engine

  codegen/scripts/field_extractor.pl is a masterpiece of Perl introspection:

  - Symbol Table Scanning: Examines %Package:: symbol tables to find ALL hash variables
  - Composite Detection: Uses patching system to detect AddCompositeTags() calls and mark composite tables
  - JSON Streaming: Outputs symbols as JSON Lines for memory efficiency
  - Smart Filtering: Handles non-serializable Perl references (code refs, blessed objects)
  - Pattern Preservation: Maintains exact ExifTool data structures including binary patterns

  Expression Processing Pipeline

  The system includes a complete expression compiler (codegen/src/expression_compiler/):

  - Tokenization: Full lexical analysis of Perl expressions
  - AST Generation: Recursive descent parser with operator precedence
  - Code Generation: Direct Rust code emission for performance
  - Pattern Recognition: Automatic classification of compilable vs complex expressions

  Output Location Standardization

  Implements comprehensive naming conventions (codegen/src/strategies/output_locations.rs):

  - Snake_case conversion with acronym handling (GPS → gps, not g_p_s)
  - Module directory structure (canon/, panasonic_raw/)
  - Collision detection with _pm suffixes only when needed
  - Rust-idiomatic path generation
