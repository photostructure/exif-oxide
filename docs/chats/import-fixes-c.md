✻ Thinking…

  Let me break down what the user is asking for:

  1. They want me to work on Task C from docs/todo/P07-codegen-import-fixes.md
  2. I need to read every referenced source and doc before starting
  3. I should take time for research, planning, analysis, and validation
  4. They mention that the "mystery" of canonmodelid vs canon_model_id in imports: they want codegen and src/*.rs to use the "canon_model_id" form
  5. I should NOT edit generated code - I should edit the codegen that produces the generated code
  6. Plan mode is active, so I need to research first then present a plan via ExitPlanMode tool

  Let me start by reading the P07-codegen-import-fixes.md file to understand what Task C is.

✻ Thinking…

  Now I understand! Task C is:

  "Complete MAIN_TAGS constant name fixes in all module mod.rs files"

  Let me understand what this means:
  - The task is about fixing imports of MAIN_TAGS constants in module mod.rs files
  - Currently they're importing generic main_tags::MAIN_TAGS but they should be importing module-specific constant names like:
    - exif/mod.rs → pub use main_tags::EXIF_MAIN_TAGS;
    - canon_raw/mod.rs → pub use main_tags::CANONRAW_MAIN_TAGS;  
    - casio/mod.rs → pub use main_tags::CASIO_MAIN_TAGS;
    - CRITICAL: Fix canon/mod.rs:127 from MAIN_TAGS → CANON_MAIN_TAGS to match canon/main_tags.rs:10

  The success criteria are:
  - grep -r "main_tags::MAIN_TAGS" src/generated/ returns empty
  - 29+ module files updated to use correct constant names
  - Each fix matches actual constant name in corresponding main_tags.rs file
  - cargo check shows reduction in "no MAIN_TAGS" errors

  The user mentioned the "mystery" of canonmodelid vs canon_model_id - they want the codegen to use "canon_model_id" form.

  Also, DO NOT EDIT GENERATED CODE - edit the codegen that produces the generated code.

  Let me read some more files to understand the current state and what needs to be fixed in the codegen.

  First, let me check the CODEGEN.md file to understand the codegen system better.


● Read(docs/CODEGEN.md)

  ⎿  Read 100 lines (ctrl+r to expand)



✻ Thinking…

  Let me now check what the current state of the generated modules looks like, specifically the mod.rs files and main_tags.rs files to understand the problem.


● Bash(pwd)
  ⎿  Waiting…

  ⎿  /home/mrm/src/exif-oxide



✻ Thinking…

  Good, I'm in the correct directory. Now let me understand the current problem by looking at the generated modules to see what MAIN_TAGS imports look like and 
  what they should be.


● Search(pattern: "main_tags::MAIN_TAGS", path: "src/generated", output_mode: "content")

  ⎿  Found 28 lines (ctrl+r to expand)



✻ Thinking…

  Now I can see the problem! There are many generated mod.rs files with pub use main_tags::MAIN_TAGS; but according to Task C, they should be using module-specific
   constant names like:
  - exif/mod.rs should use EXIF_MAIN_TAGS
  - canon_raw/mod.rs should use CANONRAW_MAIN_TAGS
  - etc.

  Let me check what the actual constant names are in the main_tags.rs files:


● Read(src/generated/exif/main_tags.rs)

  ⎿  Read 15 lines (ctrl+r to expand)



✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! So the exif/main_tags.rs file defines EXIF_MAIN_TAGS as the constant name, but the exif/mod.rs file is trying to import main_tags::MAIN_TAGS which 
  doesn't exist.

  Let me check a few more examples to understand the pattern:


● Read(src/generated/canon/main_tags.rs)

  ⎿  Read 15 lines (ctrl+r to expand)



✻ Thinking…

  And canon/main_tags.rs defines CANON_MAIN_TAGS. Let me check one from canon_raw:


● Read(src/generated/canon_raw/main_tags.rs)

  ⎿  Read 15 lines (ctrl+r to expand)



✻ Thinking…

  Great! So canon_raw/main_tags.rs defines CANONRAW_MAIN_TAGS. This confirms the pattern. Let me check the canon/mod.rs file that was mentioned in the task 
  specifically:


● Read(src/generated/canon/mod.rs)

  ⎿  Read 9 lines (ctrl+r to expand)



✻ Thinking…

  Interesting! The canon/mod.rs file on line 127 already has the correct import: pub use main_tags::CANON_MAIN_TAGS; - so it's not using the generic MAIN_TAGS, 
  it's using the module-specific CANON_MAIN_TAGS. That makes sense since the task description might be out of date or this one was already fixed.

  Let me also check the canonmodelid import mentioned in the user's note about the naming issue:


● Search(pattern: "src/generated/canon/*canonmodel*")

  ⎿  Found 1 file (ctrl+r to expand)



✻ Thinking…

  So there's a file called canonmodelid_tags.rs. The user mentioned that there's a "mystery" about canonmodelid vs canon_model_id and they want codegen to use the 
  canon_model_id form. 

  So the current state is that the codegen is generating canonmodelid_tags.rs but the expectation is it should be canon_model_id_tags.rs. This is the naming issue 
  they mentioned where codegen needs to handle snake_case conversion properly for acronyms like "ModelID".

  Let me look at the codegen that produces these names to understand how to fix it. But first let me run a quick check to see if there are other compilation errors
   currently:


● Bash(cargo check 2>&1 | head -20)
  ⎿  Waiting…

  ⎿  error: unexpected argument '2' found

     Usage: cargo check [OPTIONS]
     … +2 lines (ctrl+r to expand)



✻ Thinking…

  Let me check the current compilation errors properly:


● Bash(timeout 10 cargo check)
  ⎿  Waiting…

  ⎿  Error: Checking exif-oxide v0.2.0-dev (/home/mrm/src/exif-oxide)

        --> src/exif/mod.rs:429:13
         |
     … +218 lines (ctrl+r to see all)




✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! Now I can see the current state of compilation errors. There are 241 errors, and I can see several key issues that relate to Task C:

  1. MAIN_TAGS import errors: Multiple files have error[E0432]: unresolved import main_tags::MAIN_TAGS - this is exactly what Task C is supposed to fix. The error 
  shows things like:
    - src/generated/casio/mod.rs:13 - no MAIN_TAGS in generated::casio::main_tags
    - src/generated/exif/mod.rs:16 - no MAIN_TAGS in generated::exif::main_tags
    - And similar errors for many other modules
  2. Missing modules: composite_tags, file_types are missing
  3. tag_kit module missing: Many references to tag_kit:: functions that don't exist
  4. Module import issues: Some modules not found like sony::lookup_sony_white_balance_setting

  So Task C is clearly needed! The issue is that the mod.rs files are trying to import main_tags::MAIN_TAGS but the actual constants have module-specific names 
  like EXIF_MAIN_TAGS, CANON_MAIN_TAGS, CASIO_MAIN_TAGS, etc.

  Now I need to understand how the codegen system works to fix this properly. Since I'm not supposed to edit the generated files directly, I need to find and fix 
  the codegen that produces these mod.rs files.

  Let me look at the codegen code that handles this:


● Read(codegen/src/strategies/tag_kit.rs)

  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)



✻ Thinking…

  This looks like the strategy that processes tag table definitions. Let me continue reading to find the part that generates the mod.rs files:


● Search(pattern: "main_tags::MAIN_TAGS", path: "codegen/src", output_mode: "content")

  ⎿  Found 4 lines (ctrl+r to expand)



✻ Thinking…

  Bingo! I found the source of the problem. The codegen code in codegen/src/strategies/mod.rs is hardcoding pub use main_tags::MAIN_TAGS; on lines 326, 329, 332, 
  and 336. This is what needs to be fixed.

  Let me read the relevant section of this file:


● Read(codegen/src/strategies/mod.rs)

  ⎿  Read 20 lines (ctrl+r to expand)



✻ Thinking…

  Interesting! Looking at lines 320-337, I can see the codegen is actually trying to be smart about this. It's attempting to parse the main_tags.rs file to extract
   the actual constant name:

  1. Line 323: If it successfully parses the constant name, it uses: pub use main_tags::{const_name};
  2. Lines 326, 329, 332, 336: But if parsing fails, it falls back to the generic pub use main_tags::MAIN_TAGS;

  So the issue seems to be that the parsing is failing and it's falling back to the generic name. Let me see what the full parsing logic looks like:


● Read(codegen/src/strategies/mod.rs)

  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)



✻ Thinking…

  Now I can see the issue! The parsing logic looks correct in theory:

  1. It reads the main_tags.rs file content
  2. It looks for "pub static " 
  3. It finds the end with ": LazyLock"
  4. It extracts the constant name
  5. It uses that constant name in the pub use statement

  But the parsing appears to be failing and falling back to the generic MAIN_TAGS. Let me check if there's some issue with the parsing logic by testing it against 
  a real main_tags.rs file. Let me see what the actual content looks like:


● Bash(head -15 /home/mrm/src/exif-oxide/src/generated/exif/main_tags.rs)
  ⎿  Waiting…

  ⎿  //! Generated tag table definitions                 
     //!
     //! Extracted from Exif::Main via field_extractor.pl
     … +12 lines (ctrl+r to expand)



✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! So the actual content has: pub static EXIF_MAIN_TAGS: LazyLock<HashMap<u16, TagInfo>> on line 10.

  The parsing logic should:
  1. Find "pub static " - that would match the beginning of line 10
  2. Find ": LazyLock" - that would match " : LazyLock<HashMap<u16, TagInfo>>"
  3. Extract the part between: "EXIF_MAIN_TAGS"

  The parsing logic looks correct to me. Maybe there's a timing issue where the mod.rs file is being generated before the main_tags.rs file exists?

  Let me also check what the actual output in the mod.rs looks like for exif:


● Read(src/generated/exif/mod.rs)

  ⎿  Read 17 lines (ctrl+r to expand)




✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! There's the problem on line 16: pub use main_tags::MAIN_TAGS; but it should be pub use main_tags::EXIF_MAIN_TAGS;

  This confirms that the parsing is failing and falling back to the generic name. The codegen logic looks correct in theory, but something is going wrong with the 
  parsing.

  Let me also check what the canonmodelid/canon_model_id naming issue looks like. The user mentioned this is the other part of Task C. Let me see what canonmodelid
   files exist:


● Bash(find /home/mrm/src/exif-oxide/src/generated -name "*canonmodel*" -type f)
  ⎿  Waiting…

  ⎿  /home/mrm/src/exif-oxide/src/generated/canon/canonmodelid_tags.rs



✻ Thinking…

  Now let me check if there are any references to canon_model_id (the desired form) vs canonmodelid (current form):


● Bash(grep -r "canon_model_id" /home/mrm/src/exif-oxide/src --exclude-dir=generated | head -5)
  ⎿  Waiting…

  ⎿  /home/mrm/src/exif-oxide/src/implementations/canon/mod.rs:    use crate::generated::canon::canonmodelid::lookup_canon_model_id;                   
     /home/mrm/src/exif-oxide/src/implementations/canon/mod.rs:                            if let Some(model_name) = lookup_canon_model_id(*model_id) {



✻ Thinking…

  Interesting! So the source code is trying to import from crate::generated::canon::canonmodelid::lookup_canon_model_id - this suggests:

  1. The file should be named canonmodelid (which it currently is)
  2. But the function inside should be named lookup_canon_model_id (with underscores)

  Let me check what's actually in that file:


● Read(src/generated/canon/canonmodelid_tags.rs)

  ⎿  Read 14 lines (ctrl+r to expand)



✻ Thinking…

  Hmm, this file only contains tag definitions (CANON_CANONMODELID_TAGS), not the lookup function (lookup_canon_model_id). Let me check if there's a separate 
  canonmodelid.rs file (not canonmodelid_tags.rs):


● Bash(find /home/mrm/src/exif-oxide/src/generated -name "*canonmodel*" | grep -v _tags)
  ⎿  Waiting…

  ⎿  No matches found



✻ Thinking…

  No other canonmodel files. Let me check if there should be a module named canonmodelid in the canon/mod.rs:


● Search(pattern: "canonmodelid", path: "src/generated/canon/mod.rs", output_mode: "content")

  ⎿  Found 2 lines (ctrl+r to expand)



✻ Thinking…

  I see. So the canon/mod.rs is declaring pub mod canonmodelid_tags; and pub use canonmodelid_tags::*;, but the source code is trying to import from 
  canonmodelid::lookup_canon_model_id (without the _tags suffix).

  This suggests that the expected structure is:
  - A module named canonmodelid (not canonmodelid_tags) 
  - That contains a function lookup_canon_model_id

  But what we currently have is:
  - A module named canonmodelid_tags 
  - That contains only tag definitions, not lookup functions

  This is likely a naming/generation issue in the codegen where it should be generating both:
  1. canonmodelid.rs with lookup functions  
  2. canonmodelid_tags.rs with tag definitions

  OR the import should be updated to use the correct module name.

  The user mentioned this is about canonmodelid vs canon_model_id - they want the "canon_model_id" form. This could mean:
  1. The file should be named canon_model_id.rs instead of canonmodelid_tags.rs
  2. OR the function should be named consistently

  Let me check if there are other compilation errors that might give more context about this naming issue:


● Bash(timeout 5 cargo check 2>&1 | grep -A 2 -B 2 canonmodel)
  ⎿  Waiting…

  ⎿  error: unexpected argument '2' found

     Usage: cargo check [OPTIONS]
     … +2 lines (ctrl+r to expand)




✻ Thinking…

  Let me search for canonmodel in the compilation errors I already captured:


● Search(pattern: "canonmodel", path: "src/implementations")

  ⎿  Found 1 file (ctrl+r to expand)



✻ Thinking…

  Let me check that file to see exactly what's expected:


● Read(src/implementations/canon/mod.rs)

  ⎿  Read 30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)



✻ Thinking…

  Let me search for the specific import that's failing:


● Search(pattern: "canonmodelid::lookup_canon_model_id", path: "src", output_mode: "content")

  ⎿  Found 1 line (ctrl+r to expand)



✻ Thinking…

  Let me see that line and its context:


● Read(src/implementations/canon/mod.rs)

  ⎿  Read 10 lines (ctrl+r to expand)



✻ Thinking…

  Now I understand the full scope of Task C and the issues to be resolved! Based on my research, here are the main issues:

  Task C: Complete MAIN_TAGS constant name fixes in all module mod.rs files

  Issues identified:

  1. MAIN_TAGS import issues: The codegen in codegen/src/strategies/mod.rs is intended to extract the correct constant names (like EXIF_MAIN_TAGS, CANON_MAIN_TAGS)
   from the generated main_tags.rs files, but the parsing is failing and falling back to the generic main_tags::MAIN_TAGS import, which doesn't exist.
  2. Missing module issue: The code expects crate::generated::canon::canonmodelid::lookup_canon_model_id but there's only a canonmodelid_tags.rs file with tag 
  definitions, not a canonmodelid.rs file with lookup functions.
  3. Snake case conversion issue: The user mentioned they want "canon_model_id" form instead of "canonmodelid" - this suggests the codegen's snake_case conversion 
  for ExifTool symbols like "canonModelID" needs improvement.
  4. Multiple module files affected: 28+ module files have incorrect main_tags::MAIN_TAGS imports.

  Let me create a plan to fix these systematically.

     ☐ Verify that cargo check shows reduction in MAIN_TAGS import errors




✻ Thinking…

  Now let me do one final check to understand exactly what the parsing issue might be. Let me simulate the parsing logic manually to see where it fails:


● Bash(grep -n "pub static.*: LazyLock" /home/mrm/src/exif-oxide/src/generated/exif/main_tags.rs)
  ⎿  Waiting…

  ⎿  10:pub static EXIF_MAIN_TAGS: LazyLock<HashMap<u16, TagInfo>> = LazyLock::new(|| {



✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! So the line is: pub static EXIF_MAIN_TAGS: LazyLock<HashMap<u16, TagInfo>> = LazyLock::new(|| {

  The parsing logic should:
  1. Find "pub static " at position in the string → matches "pub static EXIF_MAIN_TAGS: LazyLock<HashMap<u16, TagInfo>>"
  2. Find ": LazyLock" from that position → should match ": LazyLock<HashMap<u16, TagInfo>>"  
  3. Extract the substring between "pub static " and ": LazyLock" → should be "EXIF_MAIN_TAGS"

  The logic looks correct. The issue might be that:

  1. Timing issue: The mod.rs files are generated before the main_tags.rs files exist
  2. Path issue: The path to main_tags.rs might be incorrect when reading
  3. Parsing bug: There might be a subtle bug in the string handling

  Now I have enough information to present a comprehensive plan.


                                                                                                                                                                   
●User approved Claude's plan:
  ⎿ Task C: Complete MAIN_TAGS constant name fixes in all module mod.rs files

    Problem Summary

    The codegen system is generating incorrect imports in module mod.rs files. Currently 28+ modules have pub use main_tags::MAIN_TAGS; but should use 
    module-specific constant names like pub use main_tags::EXIF_MAIN_TAGS;, pub use main_tags::CANON_MAIN_TAGS;, etc.

    Root Cause Analysis

    The parsing logic in codegen/src/strategies/mod.rs lines 320-337 is designed to extract correct constant names from generated main_tags.rs files, but it's 
    failing and falling back to generic MAIN_TAGS. The issue is likely:
    1. Timing: mod.rs generated before main_tags.rs files exist
    2. Path resolution: Incorrect path when reading main_tags.rs content
    3. Parsing logic: Subtle bug in string extraction

    Implementation Plan

    Phase 1: Debug and fix parsing logic

    1. Analyze the parsing failure: Add debug logging to codegen/src/strategies/mod.rs:315-337 to see exactly where the parsing fails
    2. Test parsing logic: Manually verify the regex/string matching against actual main_tags.rs content
    3. Fix the parsing: Ensure robust extraction of constant names like "EXIF_MAIN_TAGS" from lines like pub static EXIF_MAIN_TAGS: LazyLock<HashMap<u16, TagInfo>>

    Phase 2: Address canonmodelid naming issue

    1. Investigate missing lookup function: Determine why canonmodelid::lookup_canon_model_id is expected but only canonmodelid_tags.rs exists
    2. Check snake_case conversion: Verify if "canonModelID" → "canonmodelid" vs "canon_model_id" conversion is correct per user requirements
    3. Fix naming consistency: Ensure codegen produces names that match source code expectations

    Phase 3: Regenerate and verify

    1. Run codegen: Execute make codegen to regenerate all affected mod.rs files
    2. Verify fixes: Check that grep -r "main_tags::MAIN_TAGS" src/generated/ returns empty
    3. Compilation test: Verify cargo check shows significant reduction in MAIN_TAGS import errors

    Expected Outcomes

    - All 28+ module mod.rs files will use correct constant names (EXIF_MAIN_TAGS, CANON_MAIN_TAGS, etc.)
    - Reduction in compilation errors from ~241 to focus on remaining issues
    - Proper module-specific constant imports throughout generated code
    - Resolution of canonmodelid naming consistency issues

    Files to be modified

    - codegen/src/strategies/mod.rs (lines 315-337) - Fix parsing logic
    - All generated src/generated/*/mod.rs files (via codegen regeneration)
    - Potentially naming conversion logic if canonmodel issue requires it



✻ Thinking…

  Great! The user has approved my plan. Now I can start implementing the fixes. Let me update my todo list and begin with Phase 1 - debugging and fixing the 
  parsing logic.

  First, let me update my todos to be in-progress:


● Update Todos

  ⎿  ☒ Research Task C requirements and current state of compilation errors                                                    
     ☐ Debug why codegen parsing of main_tags.rs files is failing and falling back to generic MAIN_TAGS

     ☐ Run codegen to regenerate all module mod.rs files with correct constant names
     ☐ Investigate canonmodelid vs canon_model_id naming issue and missing lookup function
     ☐ Verify that cargo check shows reduction in MAIN_TAGS import errors



✻ Thinking…

  Now let me start by examining the current parsing logic more closely to understand where it's failing. Let me read the full function that contains the parsing 
  logic:


● Read(codegen/src/strategies/mod.rs)

  ⎿  Read 80 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


✻ Thinking…

  Now I can see the full parsing logic. Let me analyze what might be going wrong:

  1. Line 316: let main_tags_path = module_dir_path.join("main_tags.rs"); - This constructs the path to the main_tags.rs file
  2. Line 317: if let Ok(main_tags_content) = fs::read_to_string(&main_tags_path) - This reads the file content
  3. Line 319: if let Some(start) = main_tags_content.find("pub static ") - This finds the first occurrence of "pub static "
  4. Line 320: if let Some(end) = main_tags_content[start..].find(": LazyLock") - This finds ": LazyLock" from the start position
  5. Line 321: let constant_def = &main_tags_content[start..start + end]; - This extracts the substring
  6. Line 322: if let Some(const_name) = constant_def.strip_prefix("pub static ") - This strips the prefix to get the constant name

  The logic looks correct. Let me add some debug logging to see exactly where it's failing. But first, let me test if this might be a timing issue - are the 
  main_tags.rs files being generated after the mod.rs files?

  Let me check when this function is called and in what order the files are generated:


● Search(pattern: "update_main_mod_file", path: "codegen/src", output_mode: "content")

  ⎿  Found 3 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


✻ Thinking…

  Let me see when this function is called in the flow:


● Read(codegen/src/strategies/mod.rs)

  ⎿  Read 15 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


✻ Thinking…

  So the update_main_mod_file is called AFTER all strategies finish extraction (line 162), which means after all the main_tags.rs files should have been generated.
   That suggests it's not a timing issue.

  Let me add some debug logging to see exactly where the parsing is failing. I need to modify the parsing logic to be more robust and include debug output:


● Update(codegen/src/strategies/mod.rs)

  ⎿  Updated codegen/src/strategies/mod.rs with 13 additions

  Great! I can see that the debug output I added is working perfectly! Let me look at the debug output to see what happened:

  Looking at the debug output, I can see that the parsing appears to have worked correctly! The exif/mod.rs file already shows pub use main_tags::EXIF_MAIN_TAGS; 
  on line 15 in the system-reminder output, which means the parsing DID work for that module.

  But wait, earlier when I ran the grep command, I found that many modules still have the generic main_tags::MAIN_TAGS import. Let me check the current state again
   to see which modules are still failing.

  Let me look at the debug output more carefully:


● Bash(grep -n "main_tags::EXIF_MAIN_TAGS" /home/mrm/src/exif-oxide/src/generated/exif/mod.rs)
  ⎿  Waiting…

  ⎿  15:pub use main_tags::EXIF_MAIN_TAGS;


✻ Thinking…

  Excellent! The parsing logic is working for the exif module. The debug logging I added seems to have helped, or possibly it was a timing issue that got resolved 
  when I regenerated that one module.

  Let me now update my todos and run the codegen for more modules to see if the parsing works consistently:


● Update Todos

     ☐ Verify that cargo check shows reduction in MAIN_TAGS import errors



✻ Thinking…

  The parsing logic is actually working! The issue was likely a timing issue or something else. Let me run codegen for a few more modules to test this and then 
  regenerate all modules to fix the MAIN_TAGS issue:


● Bash(env RUST_LOG=info cargo run --bin generate_rust -- --modules Canon.pm)

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! I can see that the parsing is now working for both exif and canon modules! Looking at the system-reminder output:

  1. exif/mod.rs (line 15): pub use main_tags::EXIF_MAIN_TAGS; ✅
  2. canon/mod.rs (line 122): pub use main_tags::CANON_MAIN_TAGS; ✅

  So the debug logging I added was working, and the parsing logic is functioning correctly now. The issue might have been a timing issue where the mod.rs files 
  were being generated before the main_tags.rs files existed. 

  Now let me run the complete codegen to regenerate all modules and fix all the MAIN_TAGS import issues:
