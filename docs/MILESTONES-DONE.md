# Completed exif-oxide Implementation Milestones

This document contains the history of completed milestones for exif-oxide development.

---

## ✅ Milestone 0a: Minimal CLI & Registry (COMPLETED)

Created basic CLI with JSON output and registry system for PrintConv/ValueConv runtime lookup. Established integration test framework with graceful fallback to raw values for missing implementations.

---

## ✅ Milestone 0b: Code Generation Pipeline (COMPLETED)

Built Perl extraction script to analyze ExifTool tables and generate Rust code with tag constants and conversion references. Established automatic generation of mainstream tags filtered by usage frequency.

---

## ✅ Milestone 1: File I/O & JPEG Detection (COMPLETED)

Implemented file I/O with magic byte detection for JPEG and TIFF formats. Added complete JPEG segment scanner to locate EXIF data in APP1 segments.

---

## ✅ Milestone 2: Minimal EXIF Parser (COMPLETED)

Built TIFF/EXIF header parser with endianness detection and IFD entry processing. Successfully extracted first real tags (Make, Model, Orientation) from Canon test images.

---

## ✅ ExifTool Compatibility Testing (COMPLETED)

Established systematic compatibility testing against ExifTool reference output with automated JSON comparison. Achieved 53/58 test files passing with proper exclusion system for problematic files.

---

## ✅ Milestone 3: More EXIF Formats (COMPLETED)

Added support for BYTE, SHORT, LONG formats with proper endianness and offset-based value extraction. Implemented PrintConv conversion system with first manual implementations for Orientation, ResolutionUnit, and YCbCrPositioning.

---

## ✅ Milestone 4: First PrintConv - Orientation (COMPLETED)

Implemented complete PrintConv registry system with runtime lookup and graceful fallback. Successfully converted Orientation values to human-readable format ("Rotate 270 CW" instead of "8") with exact ExifTool compatibility.

---

## ✅ Milestone 5: SubDirectory & Stateful Reader (COMPLETED)

Built stateful ExifReader with recursion prevention and comprehensive processor dispatch system. Established infrastructure for nested IFD processing with support for ExifIFD, GPS, InteropIFD, and MakerNotes subdirectories.

---

## ✅ Milestone 6: RATIONAL Format & GPS (COMPLETED)

Implemented RATIONAL/SRATIONAL format support with proper endianness and zero-denominator handling. Successfully extracted GPS coordinates as raw rational arrays with GPS IFD subdirectory processing.

---

## ✅ Milestone 7: More PrintConv Implementations (COMPLETED)

Implemented 5 core PrintConv functions: Flash, ColorSpace, WhiteBalance, MeteringMode, and ExposureProgram with exact ExifTool compatibility. Discovered Flash uses direct hash lookup (not bitmask) and added support for manufacturer-specific edge cases.

---

## ✅ Milestone 8a: Enhanced Code Generation & DRY Cleanup (COMPLETED)

Eliminated manual maintenance of conversion references by auto-generating them from ExifTool tables. Implemented milestone-based configuration system for supported tags with quality control gates.

---

## ✅ Milestone 8c: Group-Prefixed Tag Names (COMPLETED)

Implemented group-prefixed tag names ("EXIF:Make", "GPS:GPSLatitude") to eliminate tag name collisions and match ExifTool's -G mode. Updated all tests and compatibility framework to handle prefixed output.

---

## ✅ Milestone 8d: Basic Composite GPS Tags (COMPLETED)

Built composite tag infrastructure with GPS coordinate conversion from raw rational arrays to decimal degrees. Implemented two-phase processing: extract raw tags, then build composite tags with proper dependency handling.

---

## ✅ Milestone 8e: Fix GPS ValueConv vs Composite Confusion (COMPLETED)

Refactored GPS coordinate conversion from ValueConv to proper Composite tags, establishing clean architectural separation. GPS coordinate tags now return raw rational arrays while Composite tags handle coordinate conversion.

---

## ✅ Milestone 8f: Composite Tag Codegen & Infrastructure (COMPLETED)

Extracted 62 composite tag definitions from ExifTool tables and generated complete infrastructure with dependency resolution. Implemented working ShutterSpeed composite demonstrating the foundation for future composite tag expansion.
