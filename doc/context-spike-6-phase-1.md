This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of
    context. The conversation is summarized below:
    Analysis:
    Let me chronologically analyze the conversation to ensure I capture all critical
    details:

    1. **Initial Request**: User asked to work on Spike 6 in @doc/SPIKES-20250622.md
    with an emphasis on creating an "ultrathink" plan. They requested I read CLAUDE.md,
    third-party/exiftool/CLAUDE.md, and @doc/EXIFTOOL-SYNC.md for context.

    2. **Research Phase**:
       - Read SPIKES document showing Spike 6 is about DateTime Intelligence with goals
    to port exiftool-vendored's datetime heuristics
       - Read CLAUDE.md for project context - exif-oxide is a Rust reimplementation of
    ExifTool
       - Read EXIFTOOL-SYNC.md for synchronization strategy with ExifTool
       - Explored existing codebase to understand current datetime handling (minimal -
    just tag definitions)

    3. **Plan Development Phase**:
       - Created initial comprehensive plan with 4 phases
       - Went through 3 critique cycles as requested
       - Critiqued initial plan for timezone database scalability, over-engineering,
    missing error recovery
       - Created 3 alternative plans: Simplified Pragmatic, ExifTool-First
    Compatibility, Performance-Optimized
       - Synthesized final hybrid plan combining best aspects

    4. **Implementation Phase**:
       - Added chrono dependency to Cargo.toml
       - Created datetime module directory structure
       - Implemented 8 modules: mod.rs, types.rs, parser.rs, extractor.rs,
    gps_timezone.rs, utc_delta.rs, quirks.rs, intelligence.rs
       - Each module implemented core functionality with comprehensive tests

    5. **Compilation Issues**:
       - Duplicate lazy_static dependency - removed
       - Missing XmpData type - corrected to XmpMetadata
       - Missing serde traits on FixedOffset - removed Serialize/Deserialize derives
       - Missing imports for traits (Datelike, Timelike, Utc) - added
       - Deprecated chrono API (from_ymd_opt) - updated to use NaiveDate
       - Borrowing issues in cross_validate_datetimes - fixed by cloning values
       - Unused variables and imports - prefixed with _ or removed

    6. **User Feedback**:
       - When I tried to web fetch, user interrupted and directed me to
    third-party/exiftool-vendored.js instead
       - User's final request was to update TODO.md with completion tasks including
    context and tribal knowledge

    7. **Final Work**: Updated TODO.md with comprehensive completion roadmap including
    immediate tasks, short/medium/long-term goals, tribal knowledge, and development
    workflow.

    Key technical decisions made:
    - Hybrid architecture using chrono for datetime + custom EXIF wrapper
    - Priority-based timezone inference matching exiftool-vendored
    - Confidence scoring 0.0-1.0 with source attribution
    - GPS (0,0) rejection as invalid
    - ±14 hour timezone limit enforcement
    - Graceful degradation on failures

    Summary:
    1. **Primary Request and Intent**:
       - Work on Spike 6 (DateTime Intelligence) from SPIKES-20250622.md
       - Create an "ultrathink" plan with multiple critique cycles (minimum 3)
       - Read context files (CLAUDE.md, third-party/exiftool/CLAUDE.md, EXIFTOOL-SYNC.md)
       - Implement datetime intelligence to port exiftool-vendored's timezone heuristics
     including:
         - Multi-source timezone inference
         - GPS-based timezone lookup
         - Manufacturer quirk handling
         - Subsecond precision support
         - Validation against known issues
       - Update TODO.md with completion tasks including relevant context and tribal
    knowledge

    2. **Key Technical Concepts**:
       - **exif-oxide**: Rust reimplementation of Phil Harvey's ExifTool
       - **DateTime Intelligence**: Sophisticated timezone inference from multiple
    sources
       - **Timezone Inference Priority**: Explicit tags > GPS coordinates > UTC delta >
    manufacturer quirks
       - **Confidence Scoring**: 0.0-1.0 scale indicating timezone inference reliability
       - **chrono crate**: Rust datetime handling library
       - **ExifTool Compatibility**: Matching behavior of 25+ years of accumulated
    camera knowledge
       - **GPS (0,0) Invalid**: Specific pattern from exiftool-vendored to reject
    invalid coordinates
       - **DST Bugs**: Manufacturer-specific issues (e.g., Nikon DST bug)
       - **Graceful Degradation**: Continue parsing despite timezone inference failures

    3. **Files and Code Sections**:
       - **Cargo.toml**
         - Added chrono dependency with serde feature
         - Fixed duplicate lazy_static entry
         ```toml

         chrono = { version = "0.4", features = ["serde"] }  # DateTime handling and
    timezone support

       - **TODO.md** (Updated)
         - Comprehensive completion roadmap with immediate/short/medium/long-term tasks
         - Tribal knowledge documentation
         - Development workflow and performance targets

    4. **Errors and Fixes**:
       - **Duplicate lazy_static dependency**:
         - Removed duplicate entry from Cargo.toml

       - **Missing XmpData type**:
         - Corrected to XmpMetadata after checking actual type name

       - **Serde traits on FixedOffset**:
         - Removed Serialize/Deserialize derives as FixedOffset doesn't implement them

       - **Missing trait imports**:
         - Added `use chrono::Datelike;` for year/month/day methods
         - Added `use chrono::Timelike;` for hour/minute/second methods
         - Added `use chrono::Utc;` in test modules

       - **Deprecated chrono API**:
         - Changed from `Utc.ymd_opt()` to `NaiveDate::from_ymd_opt()`
         - Pattern: `Utc.with_ymd_and_hms(2024, 3, 15, 14, 30, 0).unwrap()` for new API

       - **Borrowing issues**:
         - Fixed by cloning values before borrowing in `cross_validate_datetimes`

       - **User redirect on web fetch**:
         - User interrupted WebFetch attempt and directed to local
    third-party/exiftool-vendored.js

    5. **Problem Solving**:
       - **Architecture Design**: Created hybrid approach balancing pragmatism with
    sophistication
       - **Timezone Database**: Placeholder implementation with plan for tzf-rs
    integration
       - **API Compatibility**: Designed to extend existing BasicExif without breaking
    changes
       - **Performance**: Targeted <5ms overhead with specific optimization points
    identified
       - **ExifTool Knowledge Transfer**: Systematic approach to port 25 years of camera
     knowledge

    6. **All User Messages**:
       - "Let's work on Spike 6 in @doc/SPIKES-20250622.md -- be sure to read @CLAUDE.md
     and third-party/exiftool/CLAUDE.md and @doc/EXIFTOOL-SYNC.md . # Ultrathink a great
    plan"
       - "[Request interrupted by user for tool use]the repo is in
    third-party/exiftool-vendored.js"
       - "please update the TODO.md with what needs to be done to complete this work.
    Include relevant context and tribal knowledge to expedite completion."

    7. **Pending Tasks**:
       - Fix test suite compilation issues (deprecated chrono API)
       - Integrate datetime intelligence with public API (lib.rs)
       - Add integration tests comparing with ExifTool output
       - Replace placeholder GPS timezone lookup with tzf-rs
       - Implement real manufacturer quirks from ExifTool
       - Add XMP datetime extraction support

    8. **Current Work**:
       Just completed updating TODO.md with comprehensive completion roadmap including:
       - Immediate tasks (2-3 hours): Fix tests, API integration, integration tests
       - Short-term (1-2 days): Timezone database, performance optimization, quirks
       - Medium-term (3-5 days): Extended tag support, XMP integration, validation
       - Long-term (1-2 weeks): Production hardening, documentation, optimization
       - Tribal knowledge: Architecture decisions, ExifTool patterns, technical debt
       - Development workflow with specific commands

    9. **Optional Next Step**:
       Based on the user's request to update TODO.md (which is now complete), and the
    comprehensive roadmap laid out, the logical next step would be to begin the
    "IMMEDIATE" tasks listed in TODO.md, starting with fixing the test suite compilation
     issues. However, since the user's last explicit request was only to update TODO.md
    with completion tasks, I should wait for further direction rather than proceeding
    autonomously..
